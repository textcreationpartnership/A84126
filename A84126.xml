         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Therefore Friends and People, all be adviſed by him who is your Friend; and take the Counſel of the Apoſtle, in the 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examin your ſelves whether you be in the Faith, &amp;c.</hi> For through Faith alone you come to have an Intereſt in the Salvation purchaſed by Chriſt Jeſus the Eternal Son of the Father; who was in the Beginning with the Father, as it is in Prov. 8. from 22, to 31. read them Verſes, and conſider, and weigh them well; for this is he in whom your Faith muſt ſtand, and not in another; this is he whoſe delight is with the Children of Men, and through whom the Wonderful love of God came to be made manifeſt unto the Sons and Daughters of Men in the Reſtoration, after Man had run into Rebellion againſt God, and loſt that glorious Likeneſs or Image that he had at the firſt, when God Breathed into him the Breath of Life, through which he became a living Soul; and ſo long as he kept in faithfulneſs to the Lord, he kept his Dominion over the Creatures, and his Habitation as in the
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151551:3"/> Garden of God, the Garden of his delight; where the Trees of God did flouriſh, and the Tree of Life in the midſt thereof: The Lamb was not ſlain then. But when Man turned aſide from following the Lord, and hearken<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to the voice of the Serpent; then Death was known, then was the Lamb ſlain; when this World of Wickedneſs (the Foundation thereof) was laid by the Enemy, <hi>then was Man caſt out of the Paradiſe of God, into the Earth which was curſed for his ſake, where the Thornes and Thiſtles is brought forth, and the way to the Tree of Life ſtopped up; for the Cherubim and the flaming-Sword was there, which turneth every way, that Man in the old</hi> Adams <hi>ſtate, cannot come neer to Eat or Taſt of the Tree of Life.</hi> Oh People! Behold, here is your ſtate; <hi>every one in Old</hi> Adam, <hi>all ſeparate from God, from the Covenant of Life, without God in the World, even in the World of Wickedneſs, in Death, in the Curſe:</hi> this is your ſtate and condition whileſt you remain here, untill you come to know a coming forth, till you come to witneſs the Seed of the Woman to Bruiſe the Head of the Serpent, to overthrow his Power, who is the Prince of Darkneſs, and is the chief Ruler in Man in the ſtate of Diſobedience.</p>
                  <p>So Friends, it is high time for you to return to the Lord, and conſider, e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven in this your Day, the things that belong to your Peace before they be hidden from your Eyes; for ſuch a time will aſſuredly come to paſs, as ever it did upon the Old World; they had a day when the Lord ſtrove with them, but they would not hearken, but turned aſide into the Evil Imaginations; then their day paſſed over, and the Spirit of the Lord ceaſt ſtriving, and the Flood came and deſtroyed them all, except eight Perſons; ſo mind your time, leſt it paſs over your Head ere you are aware; and the Flood of Gods Wrath come, and ſweep you all away, as it did them.</p>
                  <p>So all People come unto Chriſt Jeſus the Gift of God, and believe in him, that through him you may come to witneſs Salvation: For as the Servant of the Lord did teſtifie in Ages by paſt, ſo do we witneſs the ſame, there is no other Name given under Heaven, whereby we may be ſaved, but by Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt alone, which is not the bare Outward Viſible Appearance or Body only, but as he was teſtified of by Gods faithful Witneſſes, even in that Age; who although they did bear witneſs to the Outward Man or Body, yet they did not exclude the Godhead, when they ſaid, Act 2. <hi>Jeſus of Nazareth, a Man approved of God by Miracles and Wonders, &amp;c.

                  <p>To which I anſwer, It was the chief work of that day or time, to bear witneſs to him who had been ſet at nought by the Chief Prieſts and Rulers, and by the generality of the People; whom they alſo put to Death, even to the ſhameful Death of the Croſs; as it was written by the Prophet long be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore, <hi>He was numbred with Tranſgreſſors, &amp;c.</hi> For notwithſtanding all the Miracles which he had wrought among them, they would not believe that this was he that ſhould come (no more then People now adays can believe in his Spiritual Appearance) but they were looking out in the Carnality of their Minds, <hi>for another to appear,</hi> according to their Imaginations, as People are in this Age and Generation, and will not receive the true Chriſt within them; therefore the Witneſſes of God in that day were the more engaged to bear ſo ſtrict a teſtimony to his Bodily Appearance, <hi>that this was he that was to come, and they were not to look for another:</hi> And ſo gives them plainly to underſtand, that the Lord had exalted him into his Kingdom, for he had made him both Lord and Chriſt; whoſe Kingdom was not Carnal but Spiritual; as he him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid, <hi>my Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> But did this Teſtimony deny the Godhead? for conſider, by what Power were theſe Miracles done? was it as he was meerly Man, or by a higher Power? See John 14.10. <hi>The Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the works,</hi> ſaith <hi>Jeſus</hi> himſelf, he there bearing witneſs to the Eternal power that dwelt in him: And verily People, if Mans Salvation had been wholy perfected by the <gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And <hi>John</hi> did bear witneſs to the Word which was in the beginning, John 1.1. <hi>which Word the World was made by,</hi> and ſaith of it, <hi>that it was God, &amp; in this Word was Life,</hi> Verſ. 4. <hi>and the Life was the Light of Men,</hi> and this was the Light which that Faithful Witneſs of God, <hi>John,</hi> bore witneſs to; <hi>That is the true Light that Enlighteneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> Verſ. 9. So People, that which enlighteneth both you and us, and every Man that cometh into the World; is not a Natural Light, as ſome ſay, &amp; the Prieſt ſometimes; nor yet the Light of the Devil, as the Prieſt ſaith othertimes; but it is the Light of him that made the World, as V. 10. <hi>and this is he that was made Fleſh.</hi> V. 14. <hi>&amp; the Word was made Fleſh &amp; dwelt amongſt us, &amp; we beheld his glory the glory as of the onely begotten Son of God, full of Grace &amp; Truth.</hi> So here <hi>John</hi> bears a full Teſtimony to the Saviour of the World, and ſo do we, who is the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the World; it is not ſaid, he takes away the Guilt o<gap reason="illegible" resp="#MURP" extent="1 letter">

The Apoſtle teſtifies to Chriſt nigh, and not to Chriſt at a diſtance; ſaying, <hi>The Word is nigh thee, in the Mouth, and in the Heart.</hi> and in the 2 Cor. 13.5. <hi>Examin your ſelves whether ye be in the Faith try your ſelves, know ye not your own ſelves that Jeſus Chriſt is in you except ye be Reprobates.</hi> and in Col. 1.27. <hi>Which is Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi> For it is no other then that Chriſt, the Saints did believe in, in dayes by paſt.

<pb n="5" facs="tcp:151551:4"/> the Name of Jeſus we Witneſs Salvation which is his Power, to which come<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we Witneſs Salvation thereby; and ſo we know not another Name through which Salvation is Witneſſed, but through this Name and this is he whom we declare of, who is not far from us; and the efficacy of his Blood we feel (as we abide in him) to cleanſe us from Sin. So I do not matter what your Teacher <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, viz. <hi>The Blood of Chriſt cleanſith no Man from Sin:</hi> It being ſo contrary unto the Apoſtles Doctrine (1 John 1.7.) which is, <hi>But if you walk in the Light as he is in the Light, we have Fellowſhip one with another, and the</hi> BLOOD <hi>of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſeth us from all Sin.</hi> And we witneſs it in its Opperation, Cleanſing and Waſhing the Soul from the Spiritual Defilements, of which ſome amongſt us are come to the experience of in our meaſure. So that we are not as thoſe that beat the Air, but we are come to experience in ſome meaſure (as I ſaid, although <hi>S. B.</hi> did mock at it) the Vertue and Power of that Grace of God which hath appeared to all Men, through which the Saints were taught in dayes by paſt, and in Ages and Generations long ſince; to deny Ungodlineſs and Worldly Luſts, and to live Godly, Righteouſly and Soberly in this preſent World; now this Grace is the ſame t at ever it was, and its teachings are the ſame, to all that are Obedient in this day as it was then, to bring Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; indeed I do not know any Doctrine ſo plentiful in the Scripture, as the Indwelling, or Inward, or Spiritual Appearance of his Spiritual Kingdom; which whoſo doth come to pertake of, muſt be redeemed from the Kingdom of the Devil. So having taken off that Reproach and Slander from Chriſt whom we believe in and is our Saviour, the firſt and the laſt, the Alpha and Omega, the Beginning and the End of the Work of God: Who <hi>S. B.</hi> call'd <hi>the Devil,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>he would prove it by the Scripture,</hi> but hath indeed fallen ſhort of his intended matter: So I leave that, and come a little to examin the proof of the ſecond falſe Aſſertion, viz.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the main End of the</hi> Quakers Meetings <hi>in theſe</hi> Iſlands: <hi>is to make the Lords Chriſt, his Holy Spirit, his Angells and Apoſtles, all Lyars and falſe Witneſſes of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now let any Reaſonable Man judge, what ground or foundation he hath to lay down ſuch a poſitive Aſſertion; for he never was at any of our Meet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings in theſe Iſlands, to know our practices in our Meetings, whereby he might diſcover our ends; but either he muſt have it by Information, or Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition, or Conſequence; Which either of theſe may prove true or falſe; and therefore whether the one or the other, it is too ſlender a ground to build ſuch an Accuſation upon, againſt an Innocent People: but whither will not Envy lead a Man?

And ſo was not before <hi>Abraham</hi> in the Body: But <hi>S.

Pſal. 2.7. <hi>The Lord hath ſaid unto me, thou art my Son, this Day have I begotten thee.</hi> This was long before the Body was, and he ſpeaks here of the time preſent, <hi>This Day have I begotten thee.</hi> Heb. 1.2. Where he ſaith, that God <hi>Hath in theſe laſt Dayes ſpoken to us by his Son, whom he hath appoined Heir of all things,</hi> (now mark) <hi>by whom alſo he made the Worlds. So he that made the World, or that Word by which the World was made, was the Son of God.</hi> John 1.10.3. Who being the brightneſs of his glory, (the Son of God he is the Brightneſs of his Fathers Glory, and the expreſs Image of his ſubſtance, and upholding all things by the Word of his Power, mark, this was the Son of God that upholds all things by the word of his Power, when he had by himſelf purged our Sins, ſat down on the Right Hand of the Majeſty on High: So ſee and conſider well and weigh this matter, and let the wiſe in Heart Judge.</p>
                  <p>For God had promiſed afore by his Prophets in the Holy Scriptures, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning his Son Jeſus Chriſt our Lord, who was made of the ſeed of <hi>David,</hi>

Rom. 1, 2.3.4.5. And this is the true Chriſt we own in his Grace and Truth, both as he was made of the ſeed of <hi>David</hi> according to the Fleſh; and as he is declared to be the Son of God with Power according to the Spirit of Holineſs, &amp;c. according to God and his Son, and his Angels, and Prophets, and Apoſtles; againſt all Oppoſers and Blaſphemers; but eſpacially againſt SAMPSON BOND, who was <hi>Prieſt</hi> at <hi>Bermudas.</hi> And we are ſorry that the <hi>Sherriffe</hi> and <hi>Juſtices of Peace</hi> in <hi>Bermudas,</hi> ſhould believe or regard his Lyes and Slanders.

If the Body barely conſidered without the Spirit had been the Lords Chriſt; then the <hi>Jews</hi> had ſeen the Lords Chriſt; for they only ſaw the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and Crucified it: But the Lords Chriſt, the Lord of Glory was vailed from their Eyes; <hi>For had they ſeen him, they had ſeen the Father alſo,</hi> John 14.9. And had they known him they would not have Crucified him: But now the unbelieving <hi>Iews</hi> had neither heard the Fathers Voice at any time, nor ſeen his ſhape, Iohn 5.37. And ſo it is clear, though they ſaw the Body, yet ſaw not the Father; they ſaw not the Eternal Power and Godhead, as they did whoſe Eyes where opened in and by the Spirit, as Old <hi>Simeons</hi> was: who ſaw through the Vail, and beheld the endleſs Power of that which made the World, and upholds it by the ſame Word of Power; <hi>who after he had purged our ſins,</hi> (ſaid the Apoſtle) <hi>ſat down on the Right Hand of the Majeſty on High.</hi> Epheſ. 4.6. <hi>And this is he who fills all things, and is above all, and in us all.</hi>
                     <pb n="8" facs="tcp:151551:6"/> So all thoſe that deſire to know their Sin purged, muſt know Chriſt, not at a diſtance only, but nigh, even dwelling in them, elſe they are Reprobates: which all the obedient in Heart do Witneſs, according to his promiſe, <hi>If a Man love me he will keep my Words, and my Father will love him, and we will come unto him, and make our abode with him.</hi> So he that believeth in Chriſt at a diſtance only, never knows a fulfilling of Chriſts Words in them, who ſaid, <hi>He and his Father would make their abode with them.</hi>

                  <p>To which I Anſwer, I deny that the Angels there do bear Witneſs meerly to the Body, for in their Teſtimony, they teſtifie to this Saviour as a King; <hi>For unto you is Born</hi> (ſaid they) <hi>in the City of David a Saviour, which is Chriſt the Lord.</hi> Which Word Chriſt relates to his Kingly Power, which was Spiritual, (as he ſaith) <hi>My Kingdom is not of this World.</hi> And the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny or Meſſage the Angel brought to <hi>Mary</hi> as concerning the Son of God, <hi>who was now coming to be made manifeſt in the Fleſh,</hi> ſaid, <hi>He ſhould Reign fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver, and his Kingdom ſhould have no End,</hi> Luke 1.33. For the Angel ſaid, <hi>Behold a Virgin ſhall be with Child, and ſhall bring forth a Son, and they ſhall call his Name</hi> Emanuel, <hi>which being Interpreted, is God with us.</hi> So here you may ſee, that the Angels bore Witneſs, more then only to the Body or Man; Mat. 1.23. as <hi>Sampſon Bond</hi> doth aſſert, which he has not proved.</p>
                  <p>So <hi>Mary</hi> believed God; and did not aſcribe the Work of Salvation to him meerly as Man, but to God; ſaying, <hi>My Spirit hath rejoyced in God my Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour.</hi> Verſ. 47. I would not have any one to think becauſe I plead ſo much for the Spirit, that I deny the Body of Chriſt; but do own it in all points, as the Scripture doth declare of it, and ſo give the Honour due unto it: Though I cannot believe the things declared by <hi>S.

                  <p>The laſt thing, which is the Apoſtles Teſtimony of Chriſt; I have ſuffici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ently ſpoke to already, and ſo ſhall wave it here: So People may ſee how far ſhort of his promiſe he came in proving his Three Accuſations, with the greateſt clearneſs from the Holy Scripture, ſo hath little cauſe to boaſt or glory of his Victory: for the Truth ſtands over his Head, and will do for ever.</p>
                  <p>The Third and laſt Accuſation is, <hi>That the prime Principles of a</hi> Quaker, <hi>is the ſame that was held and profeſſed by the</hi> Beaſts <hi>which</hi> Paul <hi>fought with at</hi> E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pheſus.</p>
                  <p>And to prove this, he firſt doth endeavour to prove, <hi>that thoſe Beaſts did deny the Reſurrection,</hi> and ſaid, <hi>ſo do we.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I anſwer, The firſt was never truly proved, and the ſecond is abſolutely falſe; his Scripture to prove the firſt, 1 Cor. 15.32. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If after the manner of Men, I have fought with Beaſts at Epheſus, what doth it avail if the Dead riſe not?</hi> Doth this at all argue that this was the <hi>Epheſians</hi> profeſt Principles? or doth it not rather argue, that the Saints loſes their reward for all their labour if the Dead riſe not, as he ſaith in the 19th Verſ. <hi>If in this Life only we have hope in Chriſt, we are of all Men moſt Miſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable.</hi> So that he hath fallen ſhort of his proof, and ſo his Accuſation is truly overthrown: But inaſmuch as he did go on to charge the thing upon us, (viz) <hi>That we do deny the Reſurrection,</hi> I do here teſtifie, that it is none of our Principles to deny the Reſurrertion, for we own it as the Apoſtles own'd it, <hi>Not the ſame Body, not a Corruptible Body, not a Natural Body,</hi> (a Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Body hath Fleſh, Blood, and Bones) <hi>but a Spiritual Body:</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>And a Spirit hath not Fleſh and Bones,</hi> ſaid Chriſt; which before he can prove he muſt be fain to get new Scripture, for the Old will maintain no ſuch Doctrines: So though he did ſtop and hinder me that time by his Mocks and Scoffs, and deriding Speeches, and clamorous Noiſe; altogether unlike a <hi>Preacher of the Everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> (as he ſaith in his Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per be is) yet now through mercy I truſt as the Truth will ſtand over your Heads, ſo I ſhall be clear of your Blood, whether you will hear or forbear; I am a Friend to the Seed, and a Lover of your Souls,</p>

                     <hi>Whoſo confeſſeth his Sins and forſakes them ſhall have mercy,</hi> which was fulfil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>led, as we may read both by and <hi>David</hi> and <hi>Peter,</hi> after they knew the Truth, and they both came again do find acceptance both with God and Man; and that it was the practice of the Chriſtians in days paſt, to upbraid any with their Tranſgreſſion or Sin after truly repented of, I do not read: ſo that for his ſo doing it appears Unnatural, and not like a Chriſtian.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to the next thing, where he ſays, the next Prater was <hi>William Wilkinſon</hi> in Page 61. where he ſays I repeated ſome of the Apoſtles words, in Col. 1.27. <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi> Now it is worth the noting here, how barely he hath brought this Scripture, without laying here down the reaſon why it was brought; which had but been fair and reaſonable ſo to have done, but as I before have ſaid, ſo here it doth appear, how he ſtrives to make his own cauſe ſtrong and ours weak, but it is not like to paſs ſo: For this I know and heard him ſay, <hi>If you</hi> (ſaid he) <hi>can prove that Chriſt was ever in any Man as a Saviour, I will lay down the Cudgels,</hi> or words to this very purpoſe; which greatly occaſioned me to bring them words of the Apoſtle, which were before mentioned, ſaying, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory,</hi> which was pretty partenent to that purpoſe, to prove that Chriſt was in Man as a Saviour: ſeeing the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory,</hi> Col. 1.27. But here methinks he ſtruggles greatly to have another meaning for the Apoſtles words, then what the Apoſtle himſelf ſaid, who ſpoke plainly.</p>
                  <p>But he ſaith, <hi>This is an inforced ſenſe, and deſtroys the true nature of the word</hi> HOPE.</p>
                  <p>Now here I would have it well conſidered by the Reader, who is moſt fit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting to be believed, the Apoſtle or <hi>Sampſon Bond:</hi> And the Apoſtle in Rom. 8.24. ſaith, <hi>We are ſaved by Hope.</hi> And in Gal. 2.20. he ſaith, <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the Life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So that it is plain, that Chriſt is in his People, both their Hope and Faith too, let this Man ſay what he will.</p>
                  <p>Again he ſaith in Page 63. <hi>That I interrupted him,</hi> ſaying, <hi>We owned Gods Preſence in Heaven and in Hell.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This I diſown to be either fairly or truly laid down, for I did not bring them Words by way of interruption; but what I ſaid tending to that matter, was by way of Anſwer to one of his Queſtions, which was to me thus.</p>
                  <p>Queſt. <hi>Is God in Heaven or in Hell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To which I Anſwered him with ſome of the Words of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> Pſal. 139.7, 8. <hi>Whither ſhall we flee from thy Preſence, if I aſcend up into Heaven thou art there, or go down to Hell thou art there.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="12" facs="tcp:151551:8"/>
                  <p>To this my Anſwer, he ſaid, <hi>I ſaid well, for ſo ſaid he, he is every where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Queſt.</hi> But ſpeedily after he asked me again, <hi>whether God was in Hell ſaved or damned?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To this Queſtion he ſaith, <hi>I Anſwered, I will not tell thee;</hi> theſe Words I utterly diſown as being then ſpoken by me: But it ſeemes it is little to him to cauſe ſuch Words to be Printed as were not then ſpoken, and ſend about the World for People to read as Truth.</p>
                  <p>But I hearing him ask this laſt Queſtion, it appeared to me ſo rediculous as amongſt Men, and ſo improper to be asked concerning the Lord, who is God over all Bleſſed for Ever, that I Anſwered (I leave it to thee) <hi>This An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer,</hi> he ſaith, <hi>was no other then a ſilly ſhift.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now it is worth the Noting how he hath ſhifted concerning his own Words.</p>
                  <p>Where he ſaith, <hi>he asked him,</hi> meaning me, <hi>Whether his God whoſe preſence he owned to be in Hell, was there ſaved or damned?</hi> This Word <hi>his</hi> I diſown to be therein mentioned, and his own foregoing Words in anſwer to me, helpeth greatly to make appear, as may be ſeen where I anſwered him to that Queſtion, <hi>Whether God was in Heaven or in Hell?</hi> with ſome of the words of the <hi>Pſalms,</hi> he ſaid, <hi>I ſaid well, for</hi> ſaid he, <hi>he is every where.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now here his Words did not relate to that ſenſe he hath ſhifted them: where he ſays, <hi>(his God)</hi> but his words related to the ſame God the <hi>Pſalmiſt</hi> ſpoke of, elſe why did he ſay, <hi>I ſaid well?</hi> But it is like he hath conſidered, ſince he asked that Unreverent <hi>Queſtion,</hi> that it was too groſs and Improper to go forth ſo as it was at firſt ſtated; therefore he would ſee to help it a little.</p>
                  <p>But ſeeing that I did not Anſwer this <hi>Queſtion</hi> according to his expectation; I have looked that he ſhould have anſwered it himſelf, for the ſatisfaction of the People that heard him: But as to that I find him ſilent, and the People left in as much Darkneſs about it as they were before, for what I ſee or know: So that I may ſay, if it were by him accounted Inconſiderable to be anſwered; it was much more Inconſiderable to have been asked.</p>
                  <p>But in that 63 Page, I find, becauſe I did not anſwer to that foul imperti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nent <hi>Queſtion</hi> before mentioned, as he would have had me.</p>
                  <p>He ſaith, <hi>I was one of their Baffling Prating Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> Methinks it would more a becomed him before he had charged me ſo high, to have had a more ſufficient ground for his charge then that was: But it ſeems it is little to him to give bad names, and cauſe to be Printed though upon too ſleight a ground: for the reaſon why I did no other wayes anſwer him, I have before given, as may be ſeen in my anſwer to that <hi>unſavoury Queſtion</hi> of his. The next thing I find he notes concerning me is.</p>
                  <pb n="13" facs="tcp:151551:8"/>
                  <p>That <hi>I repeated that place of Scripture in the</hi> 2 Cor. 5.16. where it is ſaid, <hi>Though we have known Chriſt after the Fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> This doing is like ſome of his former, as I have already mentioned, to inſert the place of Scripture, without laying down with it the reaſon or occaſion why it was brought; which might be enough to make a Sober Man admire, what I or we did mean ſo to do.</p>
                  <p>But to be ſhort, the reaſon why that Scripture was brought, was in anſwer to him, who ſtood there to affirm, <hi>Th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>The next place of Scripture which he ſaith I repeated, was the 1 Cor. 6.11. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>But ye are waſhed, but ye are juſtified by the Spirit of God;</hi> and farther he aſſerts that I <hi>Queri<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap>d,</hi> Why they, meaning us, might not be waſhed and juſtified by the Spirit now as well as others heretofore?</p>
                  <p>To which, part of his reply was, <hi>That I never had the Spirit of God in me;</hi> and to prove it he layes down three Arguments, the which I here ſleight as not worth the mentioning; only this I look upon as worth the noting, and I would have them that reads his Book take notice of it, in Pag. 65, 66, 67. where his Charge or Accuſation concerning me, as aboveſaid is mentioned.</p>
                  <p>His Charge runs thus, <hi>That I never had the Spirit of God in me,</hi> and his proof is only a recharging me in different terms, <hi>That I have not the Spirit of God in me,</hi> his Charge in both moſt uncharitably excludes me from <hi>the Spirit of God,</hi> ſaying, <hi>thou never had it, it is not in thee:</hi> And in the other two <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Now I ſay a Man would think, that he looking upon himſelf ſo wiſe and ſo learned, as it appears by his Book he does, that he ſhould not have repeated ſuch proofleſs and falſe Accuſations, <hi>as that I never had the Spirit of God in me,</hi> which I know through the mercy of God he cannot prove while he lives; yet what ſatisfaction could this be to the People that heard? To the Queſtion Propounded, the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome that were bad Sinners, as we may read in the 1 Cor. 10.11. <hi>But they were Waſhed and Sanctified and Juſtifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed

                  <p>But for all his bad Words and hard Speeches, which he hath caſt not only at me, but at the Light within alſo, which may be plainly ſeen in his Book: I can leave him to the Lord to anſwer for it, to whom every Man muſt give an ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count for the Deeds done in the Body, be they Good or Evil.</p>
                  <p>Now I having anſwered to his three falſe Accuſations mentioned in the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ginning, which he in his Book hath caſt at me; I would have it conſidered by the Reader, whether that which he hath caſt at me be not come upon himſelf; Namely, where he hath ſtriven to baffle the Apoſtles meanings to his own Words, and give another meaning to them then the Apoſtle himſelf there doth, where he ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in you the Hope of Glory,</hi> this Man, (to wit) <hi>Sampſon Bond,</hi> calls this, <hi>an inforced ſenſe,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>It doth deſtroy the true nature of the Word</hi> HOPE.</p>
                  <p>Now I would have it well conſidered by the Reader, who hath baffled he or I: I that own the Apoſtles Words, or he that has ſo far diſowned them, as his Words above mentioned hath made appear.</p>
                  <p>And where it is in all his Book, that I have either baffled or prated un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſound Words, that I have not given a ſound reaſon for what I have ſaid to him, ought to have been made appear.</p>
                  <p>But this I have to ſay to all People that are not yet convinced of the Truth; as my Teſtimony for it: That he or they that hath not Chriſt in them, (to wit) his Spirit in them, their hope of Glory, cannot come to know
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:151551:9"/> the true living hope of true Glory in them; let them Profeſs what they will.</p>
                  <p>And for this many places of Scriptures may be brought to prove.</p>
                  <p>As <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Apoſtles own Words before mentioned, Coll. 1.27. where he faith, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of Glory.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Secondly,</hi> Chriſts own Words, John 15.5. <hi>For without me you can do nothing.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Thirdly,</hi> In Phil. 2.13. <hi>For it is God that worketh in us, both to will and to do of his own good Pleaſure.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> Where the Apoſtle ſaith, Gal. 2.20. <hi>I live, yet not I, but Chriſt liveth in me, and the life which I now live in the Fleſh, I live by the Faith of the Son of God.</hi> Gal. 4.6. <hi>And God hath ſent the Spirit of his Son into your Hearts, crying Abba Father.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> In Rom. 8.24. <hi>We are ſaved by Hope.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> Rom. 8.9. <hi>He that hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, is none of his.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Seventhly,</hi> It is clear that they that are the Sons of God, are led by the Spirit of God, as in Rom. 8.14. where the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>As many as are led by the Spirit of God, are the Sons of God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Eighthly, The hope of the Wicked is to periſh, but he that hath the true living hope in him,</hi> which the Apoſtle ſpeaks of in John 2.3. <hi>purifieth himſelf even as he is pure.</hi> And again, Rom. 8.11. <hi>If the Spirit of him that raiſed up Jeſus from the Dead, dwell in you, he ſhall alſo quicken your Mortal Bodies.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Many other places of Scripture might be brought tending to the proof of what I have before aſſerted; but theſe I judge might be ſufficient.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing I find my ſelf concerned with him in his Book, is in Page 69. Where he ſaith, <hi>I called on him to make good the third part of the Charge,</hi> (viz) <hi>That the prime Principles of a Quaker, are the ſame which were held and profeſſed by the Beaſts that</hi> Paul <hi>fought with at</hi> Epheſus.</p>
                  <p>This I own indeed, that I did call upon him to make good or prove, as in his paper ſent to us he ſaid, <hi>he would do with the greateſt plainneſs and clearneſs out of the Holy Scriptures,</hi> a copy of which paper I have ſtill by me; theſe words (to wit) <hi>with the greateſt plainneſs and clearneſs</hi>) I find he has left out, and ſaith in his Book, <hi>from the Holy Scriptures.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I note it, becauſe there is a great deal of difference between proving a mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter with the greateſt plainneſs and clearnneſs out of Holy Scriptures, and proving of it by his pretended Logical Arguments and Couſequences.</p>
                  <p>Becauſe the one makes a thing perfectly appear as it is; but the other as ill managed and miſapplyed, darkens Peoples minds, as his <hi>Ergo's, it is ſo,</hi> or conſequently, <hi>it muſt be or may be ſo,</hi> in which manner of proving a matter,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151551:10"/> may be groſs erring, as I have already ſhewed, where he ſaid of me, <hi>That I never had the Spirit of God in me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>His firſt Argument to prove that, was thus formed.</p>
                  <p>Uſing the Apoſtles Words, in the 1 John 5.8. where he ſaith, <hi>There are three that bear witneſs in Earth, the Spirit, and the Water, and the Blood; and theſe three agree in me,</hi> meaning himſelf: <hi>But the Spirit that is in thee, doth not agree with the Water of Baptiſm, nor Blood of the Supper, for thou haſt renounced both the Sacraments, ther<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>Why ſhould the Spirit that is in me agree with ſuch a Popiſh Phraſe, <hi>as Blood of the Supper,</hi> any mo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>e than with <hi>Sacrament of the Altar?</hi> will this prove that I never had the Spirit of God in me, or that the Spirit of God is not in me? The like I never read in all the Scriptures of Truth, that ever any of the true Miniſters of Chriſt uſed thus to cenſure others on ſuch occaſion and terms.</p>
                  <p>But this was the way that this Man uſed to prove ſeveral of his charges againſt us.</p>
                  <p>But I minding this third Part of his Charge, which was as beforemention'd.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That the prime Principles of a Q<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>This is much like his forefathers the Scribes &amp; Phariſees, who were always forward in Judging and Condemning the Innocent, who cryed out againſt Chriſt Jeſus our Saviour, and ſaid, <hi>He was a Blaſphemer and had a Devil;</hi> as thou doſt againſt his Appearance in Spirit at this day, who begin'ſt thy Book with a Lye, and Blaſpheming in thy Mouth; but the Life in which the Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers live is out of thy Wrath, and he in whom we believe ſhall bruiſe thy Head (which is the Serpent) though thou Blaſpheme againſt his Name.</p>
                  <p>For <hi>S. Bond</hi> ſaith in the beginning of his Book, <hi>That the Quakers Saviour within him, is not the true Chriſt, but the falſe Chriſt, the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> He in whom we have believed for Salvation is the true Chriſt, whom the Angel ſaid, <hi>His Name ſhould be called Jeſus, and by the Prophet, Emanuel, which being Interpreted is God with us,</hi> Mat. 1.21, 22, 23. Whoſe out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>goings were from of Old, who ſaid, <hi>before Abraham was I am,</hi> who was with the Church in the Wilderneſs, <hi>and they drank of the Spiritual Rock which followed them, which Rock was Chriſt:</hi> 1 Cor. 10.4. And this is he in whom we have believed, who comforted and preſerved his People in all A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges, by his Spiritual Appearance in the Inward Man; and there is none
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151551:17"/> knowes him truly to be their Saviour, but who knows him Spiritually in their Hearts, who workes all their workes in them and for them.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>S. B.</hi> ſuch as thou (Blaſphemous Wretch) who call'ſt <hi>his Spiritual Appearance the Devil,</hi> may get the words of the Scripture, and prate in thy Imaginations, and deceive poor People with a Notion; who through envy and malice (which the Devil workes in thee) art Smiteing and Reproaching them who live in the Life or Spirit, which gave forth the Scripture, which thou haſt raked together in thy dark mind, to prove Jeſus of Nazareth, <hi>a man ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved of God among the People, to be the Saviour;</hi> which is not denyed by us, but aſſuredly believed in and witneſſed to be the true and only Saviour, through the work of his Eternal Power in the Inward Man, which is wrought through Faith in his Name, who in the days of his Fleſh went about doing good, and wrought Miracles, and did many mighty Works; yet the Prieſts, Scribes and Phariſees Envyed and Blaſphemed againſt him; a thou doſt againſt his Spiritual Appearance at this day.</p>
                  <p>And we alſo believe Chriſt Jeſus ſuffered by that envyous Generation of Profeſſors, Scribes and Phariſees, and was Crucified under <hi>Pontus Pilate</hi> the Roman Governour, and that he roſe again the third day, according to the Scriptures, and appeared to his Diſciples, and aſcended into Heaven, where he ſits at the right hand of the Father in Majeſty on High, who is the Mediator between God and Man, who is aſcended above all Heavens, and by whom all things do conſiſt; who ſaid, <hi>I and my Father are one, and he that hath ſeen me hath ſeen the Father,</hi> Iohn 14.7, 9, 10. Who ſaid, <hi>I am in the Father and the Father in me, the words that I ſpeak unto you, I ſpeak not of my ſelf, but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doth the work:</hi> and ſo Chriſt Ieſus hath taught us by his bleſſed Spiritual Appearance in our Hearts, not to ſeparate his Man-hood from the God-head.</p>
                  <p>As thou <hi>S. B.</hi> haſt done in thy ignorant dark Spirit; who haſt heapt up many Scriptures together in thy Book, to prove the Man-hood only the Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our; which is no more proved by thee, then if thou had ſaid nothing, for theſe Scriptures do ſeverally prove and hold forth the power of the God-head which dwelt in that Holy Body, whereby it was carryed forth and enabled in ſuffering and doing good, healing the Sick, raiſing the Dead, as it is written, and through the Eternal Spirit, offered up himſelf a Sacrifice for the Sin of the World.</p>
                  <p>So not the Man-hood without the God-head was the Saviour; as thou Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norantly, Blaſphemouſly ſeeks to prove againſt the work and power of the God-head in the Man Chriſt Ieſus, and alſo againſt his Spiritual Appearance in his People <hi>Pharaoh</hi> like, haſt given theſe wicked Epithetes (to wit) <hi>The Quakers Idol Glow-worm and the Devil;</hi> with much more Blaſphemous ſtuff, for which God will judge thee thou Hypocrite.</p>

                  <p>And S.

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> In this thou haſt falſly accuſed us, and ſeekes to make Lies thy re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and to render us odious to the People; but the Lord is opening the Underſtandings of Men, and many know us better then to believe thy Lies and Slanders, which we turn back upon thy own Head, with thy ſtory of <hi>Turks</hi> and <hi>Jews</hi> believing Chriſt died by Hiſtory, which is thy own ſtate; who art ſcoffing at the work of Salvation by Chriſt in the Hearts of his People, who knoweſt little but by Hiſtory, and therefore thou knoweſt not the vertue of the Body of Chriſt Ieſus; but art falſly accuſing others, whoſe tongue is at liberty, and thy Heart filled with malice, and thou throweſt out Lies at random. Who that is moderate and fears God will believe thee? but it may ſerve with the reſt of thy Lies and Blaſphemous ſtuff, to make thee manifeſt to the People.</p>
                  <p>For ſince we have been turned from Darkneſs to Light, and believed therein, we have known Salvation and Redemption by the pretious Blood of Chriſt Ieſus, which cleanſeth our Hearts from Sin.</p>
                  <p>And ſo the Quakers do not make theſe effects within them, to be Chriſt their only Saviour (as thou falſly chargeſt them) but we know the Operation of his Heavenly Arm and Power within us, to work theſe good effects for us; who hath opened a Spiritual Eye in us, which ſees where thou art, and the true Light ſhines (although thou in the dark Blaſphemes) which will yet make thy Folly and Darkneſs manifeſt to them that ſee it not.</p>
                  <p>Who art pleading in thy Notion and Hiſtorical belief of Chriſt without thee, which Drunkards and Profane Perſons have as well as thee, who art di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viding and ſcoffing at his Spiritual Appearance in Man, without which there is no Salvation, (but all are in the curſe) where thou art in thy Notion of Chriſt only without thee, with the Drunkards, profane <hi>Turks,</hi> and <hi>Jews,</hi> to receive thy perſon, except thou find a place of Repentance; for thy Faith can be no better then a Notion, profeſs what thou wilt, who ſcoffs and derides at the bleſſed Appearance of Chriſt Jeſus in the Hearts of his People: for it is that which gives life unto the Soul, as Chriſt Jeſus ſaid, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man and drink his Blood, ye have no life in you,</hi> Iohn 6.53. <hi>And he that eateth my Fleſh and drinketh my Blood, dwelleth in me and I in him,</hi> Iohn 6.56. But this is a Riddle to thee and ſuch as thou art, who knoweſt little but what thou knoweſt naturally like a Beaſt; wherein thou corrupts
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:151551:18"/> thy ſelf, and ſuch as thou art in all Ages oppoſed the breaking forth of the bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Inviſible Life and Power of Chriſt Ieſus who redeems Man to God, out of Death and Darkneſs, where thou art gnaſhing thy Teeth; but the re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed of the Lord whom thou ſcoffeſt at, they rejoyce in Chriſt Ieſus their Lord and only Saviour, over thee and thy Head which is the Devil, for he is a Lyar from the beginning, and is the Father of all Lyars and Blaſphemers, in whoſe work thou art found, and do not ſay this is railing, for it is thy due, as Chriſt Ieſus ſaid to thy forefathers of old, <hi>Ye Generation of Vipers, how can you eſcape the Damnation of Hell?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>Samuel Bond</hi> ſaith in the Six and Twentyeth Page of his Book, <hi>Though the Spirit be the Dead Souls Quickner, yet it is not the Quickned Souls Saviour.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Where haſt thou learnt this Doctrine thou Blind guide, who leads all into the Ditch that follow thee? It is written, <hi>The Dead ſhall hear the Voice of the Son of God, and they that hear ſhall live,</hi> Iohn 5.25. So it is by Chriſt Ieſus the dead Soul is quickened and raiſed to Life, who is the Saviour by the powerful working and operation of his Spirit in the Inward Man; and ſo thy blind aſſertion is ſeen to be words without knowledge; and in this and much more thou art found a falſe witneſs, who wouldeſt wholely exclude the Spirit in the work of Salvation, for ſaiſt thou, <hi>Though it be the dead Souls Quickner, it is not the quickned Souls Saviour,</hi> who is it (but the blind) but ſees thy confuſion herein, for Chriſt Ieſus and the Spirit are one in the work of Mans Salvation.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith in his 54 Page, <hi>That</hi> G.

                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Herein thou haſt ſpoken falſly of <hi>G.

And they that believe in the Light and obey it, they come to be the Children of the Light and of the Day: and if the Magiſtrates and all the People in <hi>Bermudas,</hi> did believe in the Light of Chriſt Ieſus; the would ſoon ſee what a blind Guide Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> is, who blaſphemes and derides the Light of Chriſt, and makes Lies his re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuge, and would through his malice and envy ſtir up the Magiſtrates of <hi>Ber<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mudas</hi> to Whip and Perſecute a People that lives peaceably amongſt them,

Page of thy Book, where thou ſaiſt, <hi>Chriſt whipt out the abuſers of the Temple, and why might not the Magiſtrates whip</hi> W. H? But Chriſt Jeſus did not whip ſuch as thou art, who ſaid, <hi>He was a Blaſphemer and had a Devil,</hi> (which was worſe then the Abuſers of the Temple,) who were like thee, who calleſt <hi>his Spiritual Appearance the De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vil:</hi> and what Chriſt Ieſus did in that matter, it was not only in reſpect of that outward Temple, but alſo Figurative of his Spiritual cleanſing of the Hearts of his People, in the Goſpel Day.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>S. B.</hi> where doſt thou find the Miniſters of Chriſt preach ſuch Doctrine as thou haſt done to the Magiſtrates in <hi>Bermudas,</hi> in theſe 3 Pages? more like a proud Phariſee, then a Miniſter of the Goſpel, as thou would be eſteem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed; who haſt got the Sheeps cloathing, but art ſeen to be Inwardly a Ravening Wolf: thy work diſcovers thee.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Sampſon Bond</hi> ſaith in his 58 Page, <hi>When</hi> Paul <hi>was Travelling in Birth for the</hi> Galatians, <hi>Chriſt was not formed in them, therefore</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>the Light which is in every Man, is not the true Chriſt, but a</hi> Quakers <hi>rotten Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciple.</hi>

                     <hi>Reply,</hi> Herein <hi>Sampſon Bond</hi> hath manifeſt himſelf to be one that ſpeaks out of thick Darkneſs, who knows nothing of the new Birth, nor travail for Chriſt to be formed in him, but calls it, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>rotten Principle &amp; the Devil.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But in Gods Day it will grind him to Powder, except he can find a place of Repentance before it be too late.</p>
                  <p>For thou dark Man, who knoweſt not what thou ſtumbleſt at; for al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though Chriſt Ieſus hath inlightned every Man that comes into the World, yet many hates the Light, as thou doſt; and ſo ſuch know not the way thereof no more then thou do'ſt, but are in Darkneſs as thou art; but it is they who love the Light, believe in it and obey it, who come to know the new Birth, and Chriſt to be formed in them, which thou knows nothing of; thy Speech which is in Darkneſs and Blaſphemy bewrays thee, and haſt laſht thy ſelf, and feel'ſt it not, who art Dead in Darkneſs.</p>
                  <p>And this is written that People may ſee where thou art, like a proud Phari<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſee, whoſe Tongue is at liberty, and prateſt like a Perrot in thy Book, which is ſtuft with Lies, Ignorance and Blaſphemy, againſt God and Chriſt, his Holy Angels, Prophets and Apoſtles; which thou moſt falſly chargeſt upon others, in the 54 Page; but art really found guilty thy ſelf.</p>
                  <p>And alſo againſt Gods People whom he hath raiſed up, by the Light of his Son Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord in this Day.</p>
                  <p>Who art Scoffing and Deriding at them; and alſo, the Light and gracious
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151551:19"/> Appearance of Chriſt in their Hearts; whereby its manifeſt thou knoweſt no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing hereof, but by Notion and Hiſtory.</p>
                  <p>For it is by the Spiritual Appearance of Chriſt, that the Eye of Mans Un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding is opened, to ſee, and through the work of Regeneration Man comes to know the worth of that one Offering; which for ever makes perfect them that are ſanctified, through the belief of the truth, and in walking in obedience thereunto, they come truly to know Chriſt to govern, rule and be head in them.</p>
                  <p>And they are Spiritual minded Men and Women, who are made ſenſible of that great work of Mans Salvation, in Chriſts offering up himſelf in the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy of his Fleſh upon the Croſs; whereby he put an end to the firſt Covenant, which ſtood in outward Sacrifices, Types and Shadows; and opened a Door, both for <hi>Jew</hi> &amp; <hi>Gentil</hi> to receive him, who is the Second and Everlaſting Co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venant; and they that know this Spiritual work, and Chriſt to be formed in them as aforeſaid; they are made pertakers of that great benefit, of what Chriſt wrought by his ſuffering without them, and are ſate down in Heavenly places, in Chriſt Jeſus, our Lord and only Saviour.</p>
                  <p>Whilſt thou <hi>Sampſon Bond,</hi> and ſuch as thou art, are foaming out your own ſhame; who ſaiſt in the 69 Page of thy Book, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>deny that Chriſts Body is riſen:</hi> which is another of his Lies.</p>
                  <p>For we do know he is riſen, and to our Juſtification, who believe in his Name; and to the condemnation of ſuch falſe Accuſers, as thou art.</p>
                  <p>But <hi>S. B.</hi> in the 18 Page of his Book, ſaith, <hi>Chriſts gracious Operation in the Heart in Scripture, is called Chriſt in you.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And we who thou in ſcorn calleſt <hi>Quakers,</hi> do believe it is he, the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures bear Teſtimony to be within his People, who is their Saviour: who in the beginning of thy Book, calls <hi>him the Devil:</hi> and ſo Phariſee like, thou art calling the Maſter of the Houſe <hi>Belzebub.</hi> And here thou haſt contradicted thy ſelf, who derideſt at Chriſts being in his People; and like a Blaſphemer, ſcoffingly, <hi>Querieſt, Whether Chriſt be in our Arms, Leggs and Guts, &amp;c.</hi> But this wicked heatheniſh work may make thee manifeſt to poor People, who have been deceived by thee.</p>
                  <p>But it is no ſtrange thing to us, whoſe Eyes God hath opened; for we know the wiſdom of this World cannot perceive the things of God, for they are Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritually diſcerned, and by his Spiritual Appearance in this latter Age of the World, God hath raiſed contemptible Inſtruments to perfect his praiſe, and to confound the Haughty Scoffer, who is glorying in his own ſhame.</p>
                  <p>As Prieſt <hi>Bound</hi> doth, with his little Schollarſhip, who is tanting and huffing in the Air, againſt an Innocent People; yet let him know, they are learned

                  <p>But by the Light and Power of Chriſt Jeſus, our Mouths are opened to bear a Teſtimony againſt the Idolatry and Blaſphemy of the Pope, and all ſuch as thou art, who are his off-ſpring; who are not yet come out of <hi>Babilon,</hi> for confuſion is your dwelling place: and although the Quakers do believe that the Light and <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>And we know the Pope is an Intruder into things which he is ignorant of and hath nothing to do with; and is a Blaſphemer, and ſo art thou, who ar, comparing the Light and Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, with the Pope and his Idola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trious Traditions, in this Compariſon.</p>

                  <p>The People ſprinkle Infants, and call it <hi>the Baptiſm of Chriſt,</hi> and ſo do the <hi>Popiſh</hi> Prieſts preach for hire, and ſo do you <hi>Presbyterians,</hi> and have taken Mens Goods from them for your gain, yea, and took their Childrens Cloaths from their Backs, and Impriſoned Men till Death, for your God, which is your Belly; and from them you haue done no Work, for what greedy Hirelings are you? Who is Worſt, you or the Pope? The Pope calls the Old <hi>Maſs-Houſe, the Church;</hi> and ſo do you.</p>

                  <p>But the Lord is redeeming his People out of your Ignorance, and Idolatrous Inventions, and from the Mouthes of ſuch Hirelings as thou art.

                     <hi>FRIEND,</hi> The occaſion of this following Diſcourſe is this, I meeting with a Book given forth by <hi>Sampſon Bond,</hi> a Teacher in <hi>Pembrook-Tribe</hi> in <hi>Bermudas,</hi> in which Book I ſee my ſelf greatly concerned for the Truths ſake, which was by him exceedingly Reviled, Reproached and Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, the Scripture greatly wronged, through falſe gloſſes or In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terpretatious upon them, forceing the Saints Teſtimony to ſpeak another thing then was truly teſtified by them in plainnes of Speech; beſides the many Lies, Abuſes and Slanders, caſt upon Friends by this malicious Prieſt, who (as it appears by his Book) cares not greatly what he ſpeakes or writes, not having reſpect ſo much as to his own credit: For theſe cauſes a neceſſity came upon me for the Truths ſake, to write this following diſcourſe. Therefore who ever thou art that reads this Book, I adviſe thee to ſtand ſingle to the Truth, removeing all prejudice out of thy Heart againſt any, neither look at the weakneſs and meanneſs of the hand that writ it, nor to the ruggedneſs of the expreſſions: all which tend directly to darken the Truth, and thereby to bring thy Soul to join in affinity with the Enemy of Gods Truth, and thy Souls
<pb n="48" facs="tcp:151551:26"/> Peace, and then being ſo far entangled in the Snare, the next thing will be, thou wilt be ingaged in the Dragons Quarrel, to take up his Weapon, to defend the Dragons cauſe againſt the Lamb. And if ſo what canſt thou expect but to receive thy Porti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on with the Dragon &amp; his Angels, under the Eternal dispeaſure of the Almighty in the day of the Lambs Victory, who ſhall certain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly overcome, for he is mighty that hath promiſed, to whom be glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry Everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>Therefore Friend or Friends in <hi>Bermudas,</hi> chiefly the place where I drew my firſt Breath, and amongſt whom I now dwell; feeling the love of God ſpringing in my Soul toward you, you were and are chiefly in my Eye, that your precious Soules may not be deceived, but that ye may be recovered out of the ſubtil Fowlers Snare, who lays wait to catch your precious Soules.</p>
                  <p>To you therefore is mine adviſe, read with Soberneſs, and ſink down in the waightineſs of your Spirits, that you may be En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lightned with the Light of Chriſt Jeſus in which you may be able to ſee and reach the thing by me intended, even the Truth to ſtand clear, and Deceit to come under the Juſt Judgment of God. And if this I obtain, then have I my deſire, who am a Friend to your Immortal Souls, and deſire your Eternal Happineſs.</p>

                  <p>BEfore I enter upon the diſcourſe it ſelf, I find it neceſſary to note a few things in the <hi>Preface to the Reader:</hi> where firſt <hi>Sampſon Bond</hi> ſeems to lay down the moving cauſe, which firſt moved him to give forth his three Queſtions with their Anſwers ſtated, which was he ſaith, <hi>He was informed of a Paper, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>had lef<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap> with a Gentleman in this Iſland, intimating a Challenge to the Miniſters, &amp;c.</hi> which Paper although ſlighted by him, he durſt not anſwer, which Paper was (by way of Challenge) given forth by <hi>Stephen Bullock,</hi> to try their God by faſting, which was the very thing upon which that word was ſpoken, (viz) <hi>That</hi> S. B. <hi>durſt as ſoon take a</hi> Bear <hi>by the Tooth as anſwer it,</hi> and not upon the account of any diſpute, and as for any other letter that was ſent afterward (as he ſaith) (viz) between the time that this Paper was given forth as a Challenge to their Miniſters, and the time he ſent his Queſtions to us, I ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver heard of any Paper that was ſent to him.</p>
                  <p>And whereas he ſaith in the ſaid <hi>Preface, That they</hi> i. e. <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>came the firſt of</hi> May <hi>following, to the place aſſigned</hi> (Mark) <hi>without giving him any special notice of it:</hi> As if we had come upon him una<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wares.</p>
                  <p>To which I anſwer, that this is abſolutely falſe, for after I had received his Paper, and ſhewed the ſame to Friends, who conſidering of the ſame, and finding his promiſe, that he deſired a regular Diſpute, Friends generally deter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mined to meet him at the place appointed; whereupon I writ a few lines to the ſaid Prieſt, to ſignifie our Acceptance &amp; our intents to meet him; and ſent the Paper by his next Neighbour, who brought me back an anſwer. Beſide the matter was made every way ſo publick, that when the day came the Houſe was greatly filled, from all parts (almoſt) of the whole Iſland, which is not uſual on their Lecture-days.</p>
                  <p>But when we came, expecting to have a regular Diſputation, (viz) that we ſhould have had liberty to have anſwered to the Charge along as he went, we found it quite another thing, as doth appear in his <hi>Preface.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>For his intent was to bind us down in ſilence, until he had quite finiſhed his whole work intended, which I perceived by the time he ſpent in the anſwer to
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:151551:27" rendition="simple:additions"/> his firſt Queſtion, he would have wearied out the Peoples patience, ſo that they would hardly wait to hear any return.</p>
                  <p>And Secondly, The Peoples Minds would have been ſo ſtuffed with his multitude of Arguments, Slanders, Lies, and falſe Accuſations; that there would not have been room for Truth to get any entrance.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly, it tended to prevent and ſtop us, ſo that we ſhould not find where to have an entrance to make any orderly reply to any thing that he ſpake; for which cauſe it was that I ſtopt him when he had ended his firſt an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer, for which he charges us with Unfaithfulneſs, who never made him no ſuch promiſe, as to give him ſuch liberty as he required.</p>
                  <p>So having noted theſe things from his <hi>Preface,</hi> I proceed to conſider his firſt Propoſition, as laid down in the firſt Page of his Book, which is as followeth.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>That a</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour (within him) is not the true Chriſt, but the falſe Chriſt, the Devil. Which</hi> (he ſaith) <hi>was proved by</hi> 4 Apoſtolical Arguments,</p>
                  <p>Firſt, <hi>Becauſe Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a Man approved of God among the People, was and is the true Chriſt and our only Saviour,</hi> for to prove which he notes many Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2.21, 22, 23, 24. <hi>Acts</hi> 4.10, 11, 12. <hi>Acts</hi> 10.38, 39, 40, 42, 43. From theſe Scriptures mentioned, <hi>S. B.</hi> draws this Argument.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>If Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a man approved of God among the People of</hi> Iſrael, <hi>be the true Chriſt and only Saviour, then a</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour (within him) is not the true Chriſt.</hi>

<pb n="52" facs="tcp:151551:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> Heart, not only from the Guilt or Condemnation, (as ye ſay) but alſo from the defilement of Sin: So is Chriſt Jeſus become the Author of E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal Salvation to all that through Faith are brought into obedience unto him. But theſe things (I judge) are a myſtery to <hi>S. B.</hi> who is ignorant of the work of Salvation, of the Grace, Hope and Faith within by Chriſt; for if he had been acquainted with the inward forming of Chriſt, he could never have formed ſuch an Argument as this, <hi>That becauſe Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a Man approved of God among the People,</hi> (in whom dwelt the fulneſs of the God-head, which was the Creator of all things) <hi>was the true Chriſt and only Saviour, that therefore the Saviour cannot be within,</hi> although the Saints did witneſs, <hi>that Chriſt in them was their Hope of glory.</hi> But to leave this, and to take a view of his 2d Argument, as laid down in the ſecond Page of his Book, which is grounded upon this.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Becauſe the Saints of God (by the direction of his Spirit) have alwayes ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>knowledged the Man Jeſus Chriſt, to be the true and only Saviour.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Upon which ground he brings forth the ſame concluſion, (viz) <hi>That Chriſt within Man,</hi> which he calls <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour within, is not the true, but the falſe Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply,</hi> This Argument is alſo falſe, being one with the other, grounded upon a foundation (as to me it appears) hid in his own Breaſt, &amp; not truly laid down in expreſs Words, yet truly intended by him; which is this, that Chriſt Jeſus (only) as Man, without the Godhead, was by the direction of the Spirit, always acknowledged to be their true and only Saviour; if this be not the ground of his A<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>gument, then could he not have formed ſuch an Argument as this; becauſe Chriſt as God is a Spirit, and ſo within as well as without.</p>
                  <p>Now for the proof of his Argument, he brings the words of <hi>Simeon, Luke</hi> 2. from Verſe 25, to Verſe 31. by which words it doth not at all appear, that the Man or viſible Body only of it ſelf is the only Saviour, for he declares of him as a Light to go before the face of all People, a Light to lighten the <hi>Gentiles;</hi> and <hi>John</hi> bore witneſs to him, and ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>He is the true Light that enlightneth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> and Chriſt him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſaid, <hi>He was the Light of the World.</hi> Which things are true, and his Light is truly felt and known in the Hearts of his Saints. So our Teſtimony we are not aſhamed to bring forth to the inward manifeſtation of the Spirit of Jeſus, by which we are inlightned, and by vvhich the Gentiles are inlightned, and is become the glory of Spiritual <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the inward <hi>Jew,</hi> whoſe praiſe is not of Men, but of God. And ſo <hi>Simeon</hi>'s Words or Prophecy of him is fulfilled, he is become a Light to the <hi>Gentiles</hi> and <hi>Iſraels</hi> glory.</p>
                  <p>He likewiſe names <hi>John</hi> 20, 27. <hi>Then</hi> ſaid Jeſus, <hi>reach hither thy finger,
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:151551:28" rendition="simple:additions"/> &amp;c.</hi> And <hi>Thomas</hi> anſwered and ſaid unto him, <hi>My Lord and my God:</hi> So this Scripture brought by him to prove his Argument hath quite overthrown it.</p>
                  <p>For by <hi>Thomas</hi> his confeſſion, the ſame Jeſus, who was the true and only Saviour of the World, was God as well as Man, and Chriſt did not at all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove him for his Confeſſion: And if God, then a Spirit, and ſo is within as well as without.</p>
                  <p>As to the fourth of <hi>John,</hi> 42. where he ſeemeth to ſay, <hi>The Men of</hi> Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maria <hi>confeſt to the Man Chriſt,</hi> [only] to this I anſwer, it was the ſame Chriſt to whom <hi>Thomas</hi> confeſt, and the ſame that was before <hi>Abraham</hi> was, even he that whoſoever ſaw truly to be the Chriſt, ſaw the Father alſo: So here having no ground to prove his Argument, which the ſaid <hi>S. B.</hi> calls <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtolical,</hi> it doth at once fall to the ground.</p>
                  <p>The third Argument that this Prieſt uſes to prove his Charge, (viz) <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>Saviour within him to be the falſe Chriſt,</hi> is in page 3.</p>
                  <p>If the true Chriſt and our only Saviour, did at once (without us) in and by his own crucfied Body on the croſs, finiſh and perfect the work &amp; office of a Saviour? ithen a <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>But the true Chriſt and our only Saviour, did at once (without us) in and by his own crucified Body on the Croſs, finiſh and perfect the whole work and office of a Saviour, therefore a <hi>Quakers</hi> pretended Saviour within him, is not the true but the falſe Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>All which he grounds upon theſe Scriptures following, <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.12, 14. <hi>Heb.</hi> 2.14. 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.24. <hi>Eph.</hi> 2.15, 16. <hi>Heb.</hi> 9.26. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.2. <hi>Col.</hi> 1.22.</p>
                  <p>Neither doth any one of theſe Scriptures prove the (whole) office of a Saviour perfected in his crucified Body (at once) upon the Croſs: Al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>though I confeſs that the whole work of a Saviour, ſo far as was of him re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quired, to be performed in and by that Body, was perfectly performed, and nothing wanting as pertaining to our Salvation.</p>
                  <p>But is this the whole office of a Saviour? Is there nothing farther to be done? Is the believing of this ſufficient, without ſanctification? Is it not the office of Chriſt (as a Saviour) to give reſt and peace to ſuch as he ſaves? muſt he not redeem from under the power of Sin, and deſtroy Sin in our mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodys? Is this no part of the office of Chriſt as a Saviour? The Apoſtle <hi>Paul, Rom.</hi> 8.2. teſtified to the work of the Spirit within, ſaying, <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free frrom the Law of Sin and Death.</hi> Now this faithful Servant of the Lo<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="54" facs="tcp:151551:29" rendition="simple:additions"/> through the Death and Sufferings of Chriſt Jeſus, and alſo triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>antly manifeſted to the World by his Reſurrection, of which there were ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny Witneſſes, as the Apoſtle doth declare, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. yet for all this the Enemy ſought to keep his hold, and <hi>Paul</hi> was ſo far ſenſible of the ſame, that it made him cry out, <hi>Oh Wretched Man that I am! who ſhall deliver me from the Body of this Death!</hi> which as he waited, he came to know a farther work of Salvation, then that which was done at once (without him) in the Crucified Body of Jeſus on the Croſs: for through the power of the ſame Jeſus (not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nother) he became crucified alſo to the World, and the World unto him; and ſo being Crucified with Chriſt, by which he felt himſelf Dead to Sin: he al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo did pertake of his Reſurrection, and ſo received a new Life, through the quickenings of Chriſt Jeſus, who lived in him, and ſo was truly made alive unto God, <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.

                  </p>
                  <p>And ſo he becomes the Author of Eternal Salvation to all that do obey him; ſo Chriſt ſaves not to halves, (as People imagin) as to pay the price of the Redemption, for ſuch as are taken Captive by the Enemy of their Souls, and yet leave them under his Power and Jurisdiction, but to as many as be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieve, Love and Obey him, he redeems alſo from under the Power of Sin and Death, and gives them dominion over it, and ſo he becomes a perfect Saviour; ſaving both within and without, ſaving to the uttermoſt all that come unto God by him.

                  <p>And whereas <hi>S.

Verſes, ſpeaks thus: <hi>The Righteouſneſs which is of Faith speaketh on this wiſe: Say not in thy Heart who ſhall aſcend into Heaven, that is to bring Chriſt down from above; or who ſhall deſcend into the Deep? that is to bring Chriſt again from the Dead. But what ſaith it? The Word is nigh, even in the Mouth and in the Heart, that is the Word of Faith which we Preach.</hi> So this Holy Apoſtle did not Preach Chriſt at a diſtance only, <hi>but Nigh in the Mouth and in the Heart,</hi> and ſuch as did not ſo know

So that you may ſee by plain Scripture, it is no new thing to acknowledge Chriſt in Man, or the Saviour within; for Chriſt is the Saviour, who is God, and cannot be limitted to one place, ſo that he cannot be elſewhere; for that were to limit the Holy One of Iſrael.</p>
                  <p>Thus having gone through his four Arguments, (which he calls <hi>Apoſtoli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>) and having tryed them by the Scripture of Truth, and finding them falſly grounded, they are by plain Scripture truly overthrown.</p>
                  <p>His next Argument in Page fourth, which <hi>S. B.</hi> brings to prove <hi>The falſe Chriſt to be the Devil,</hi> is no whit material to his Work, ſith he cannot make good his Charge againſt us.</p>
                  <p>Now this being the manner of his work on that Day Friends met him, expecting a regular Diſpute, he having gone through the four Arguments as laid down in his Book, to prove the firſt part of his Charge, he ſought to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed to his next Queſtion, or ſecond part of his Charge againſt us: But I ſtopt him, being willing to anſwer each Queſtion in its order, though the ſaid <hi>Bond</hi> did appear very unwilling, whereupon I did then Declare my Faith as concerning Chriſt Jeſus, the Saviour of the World. Contrary to his many lyes againſt us; and how he is to be acknowledged and believed in, before he took the Body; Even as the Scripture doth declare of him, <hi>John</hi> 1.1.2, 3. and likewiſe as the Scripture doth declare of him, when he took the Body how he took fleſh of the Virgin, and was born, and had his Converſation among men, and how at length he was <hi>Crucified,</hi> with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> performing the work of mans Redemption, pay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the prece. So obtaining Remiſſion of Sins through his Blood, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing dead and buried, how on the third day he roſe again from the Dead, aad alſo aſended into Heaven: as alſo I did declare my Faith as concerning his Spiritual appearanc afterward, according to his promiſe to his Diſciples: <hi>I will not leave you Cemfortleſs, I will come again</hi> John 14.17. Which promiſe he did perform unto them; and alſo now to as many as do believe and truly wait upon him, as Inward in the heart, according to his word; he dwelleth with you and ſhall be in you. <hi>ver.</hi> 17.</p>
                  <p>This <hi>S. B.</hi> calls a Bare repetition of words, Impertinent to the matter and ſaith <hi>Page,</hi> 5 I made no mention of <hi>Chriſts Reſurrestion,</hi> (which I noat as a Lye:) but before I had done he Interrupted me, (calling me Mr.) which title I denyed ſaying, that I was none of his Maſter, He ſaid I was Maſter of an Aſſembly, (not naming what Aſſembly:) here he takes upon him to judg me, and ſaith that I grew Impertinent (which I note again as falſe) all
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:151551:30" rendition="simple:additions"/> though I did lay upon him ſomething of Unfaithfulneſs, who had promiſed, that I ſhould have liberty to ſay what I had to ſay without Interruption.</p>
                  <p>Now in his Book he goes on ſo confuſedly, that it is a hard matter to trace him to and fro in his ſeveral windings, Therefore my intents are chiefly to note the Lies, Slanders and Blaſphemies, and things of the like na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, caſt upon the Truth and People of the Lord, and where I ſee occaſion a little to inlarge, that the Truth may be cleared, and ſtumbling Blocks may be taken out of the way of ſuch as deſire to know the Truth.</p>
                  <p>In Page 6. I take notice how Deceitfully <hi>S. B.</hi> caſts a ſlander upon us, pretending, how he hath fil'd off the Ruſt and Ruggedneſs of our Expreſſions; yet charging us with diſorder, &amp; diſmembring the Scripture, (which happily we might not ſpeak every Word) yet certain I am, (although many things were then caſt in) yet I did not violate or pervert the ſenſe of any one Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: Again he chargeth us with Diſhoneſty, in not Noting Chapter and Verſe, in which he did greatly boaſt. To which I then anſwered, the Words we ſpeak were Scripture Words, and he had no great cauſe to boaſt; For the Scripture was not given forth in Chapter and Verſe, neither did the Apoſtles ever ſo declare, but when they ſpeak Scripture Words, they ſaid, as it is written, naming only the Prophet or writer of the ſame; and here People may take notice of a manifeſt Slander, (viz) <hi>That it is Friends uſual manner to speak Scripture darkly and confuſedly, thereby the more eaſily to deceive thoſe, with whom the Scripture hath any Credit,</hi> Page 6.</p>
                  <p>Page 7. He goes on with his Lies and Slanders, ſaying, <hi>My deſign was to make the Hearers believe, that the Eternal Word as diſtinct from the Manhood of Chriſt, is the true Chriſt and only Saviour.</hi> As if I had gone about directly to deny the Body, which is like many more of his Charges in his Book, which are abſolute Lies and Slanders, which I ſhall note hereafter as they fall in my way.</p>
                  <p>Neither did I ever uſe any ſuch Expreſſion, for if I had ſaid, <hi>He were the true and only Saviour,</hi> (that is to ſay, according to <hi>S.

                  </p>
                  <p>Which although it is my belief, that God is manifeſt in his glorious Light, in every Man according to his meaſure, according to <hi>John</hi> 1.9. <hi>He Enlight<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neth every Man that cometh into the World,</hi> yet my Words chiefly had Refer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence to that prepared Body, in which the Inviſible Power did ſo gloriouſly ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, to thoſe whoſe Eyes was open to behold it: but this his Lie and Slander I ſhall leave upon his own Head.</p>

                  <p>Another Lie or Slander is in Page 8. where he ſaith, <hi>A Teaching</hi> Quaker, (whom he calls) <hi>a Seducing</hi> Quaker <hi>ſuch a</hi> Quaker (ſaith he) <hi>attributes no more Soul-ſaving merit to the Body of Chriſt, then to the Body of a</hi> Turk <hi>or a</hi> Jew.</p>
                  <p>All that have heard or read the Declarations of Friends, concerning the Manhood of Chriſt; can do no leſs then Judge him to be a Slanderer and a Liar.</p>
                  <p>Farther <hi>S.

                  <p>But a little to go back to the 2d Confeſſion in Page 82.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. B.</hi> calls the work of the Spirit within, <hi>no other but the effects of the thing done by the Man Chriſt without us,</hi> as if to be Sanctified. Waſhed and Purged from Sin, could not poſſibly be wrought, except firſt the Man Chriſt muſt have ſuffered without us, as the Anticedent cauſe of thoſe effects.</p>
                  <p>Whereas it is certain, that many of the Prophets and Righteous Men that lived before the Appearance of Chriſt in the Body, did Witneſs theſe things wrought within them, through the effectual working of the Spirit of God in their Hearts.</p>
                  <p>So that it is plain, that Chriſt was manifeſt to them before he took the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, as well as when he took the Body, according to the Scripture, <hi>Chriſt the ſame Yeſterday, to Day, and forever.</hi> So having finiſhed this digreſſion, I go forward again.</p>
                  <p>In the laſt line of the 8th Page, he ſaith, <hi>I belie the Holy Man</hi> John, <hi>that the Enlightning in every Man is Chriſt, (which I again teſtifie, that it is a meaſure of the Light of the true Chriſt, who is God bleſſed for ever)</hi> and to prove this a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p>I Anſwer, The <hi>Evangeliſt</hi> in them words cannot be ſo underſtood as a Man only; for he teſtifies of him as a whole or perfect Saviour; and if ſo, then God, for if he were Man only, he could not ſanctifie and cleanſe the Soul from Sin; and how then is he the Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the World? or how is the Sin taken away if it ſtill remains <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>I Anſwer, If it be ſo, then it appears that the whole work of Mans Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, (and ſo not the whole office of a Saviour) was not performed at once without us, as <hi>Sampſon Bond</hi> affirmeth in his 3d Argument; for there is ſomething to be effected within ſtill; and if ſo, who as it that works thoſe ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fects within, if it be not the Spirit?</p>
                  <p>In Page Nine, He goes on to prove the Light within, not to be the true Chriſt, by my Words, for he ſaith, <hi>My Words Imply, That thy Light in every Man is Chriſt, therefore the Light within a</hi> Quaker <hi>muſt be Born at</hi> Bethlehem.</p>

                  <p>If this be all, then it appears (by thy Judgment) that we cannot be accounted among the Number of thoſe ſpoken of in <hi>Heb.</hi> 6th for they were made pertakers of the Holy Ghoſt, and had a Taſt of the Power of the World to come: Now the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If ſuch fall away, it is im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſible to renew them again,</hi> &amp;c. beſides it was ſuch as were Sanctified, not ſuch as were only ſo in Mens opinions, and were not ſo indeed.</p>
                  <p>But I demand what the ground is of this exceeding great charge thou haſt laid againſt us, for as I have ſaid before, (in Effect) if not in plain Words, that we (whom thou in ſcorn calls <hi>Quakers</hi>) do believe in no other Jeſus then that very Jeſus, who was Born of the Virgin, who ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> whom God raiſed from the Dead by his Power, and ſhewed him openly to many who became witneſſes of his Reſurrection, of which Jeſus we have received a Meaſure, even of that fulneſs which in him dwelt, <hi>(i. e.)</hi> of his Spirit, by which we
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:151551:33"/> are Sanctified and cleanſed, even from the defilement of ſin (in mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) and do feel (as we are giving up to Obey the Spirit) (I ſay) <hi>we feel a daily growth and Increaſe of the ſame.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And now <hi>S. B.</hi> what is become of the charge thou haſt laid a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt us, for which thou haſt doomed us with no leſs then Eternal Judgment, is it for any thing elſe then that thou haſt thus Judged us, but becauſe we own the appearance of Chriſt Jeſus within us, by which he doth perform many great and mighty works in us, and for us, even to the overthrowing of the Man of ſin, and power of Darkneſs, and caſting him out of our hearts, and alſo doth ſet up his Throne in our Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ences, and ſo is become our King, who hath purchaſed us through his Blood, to be a peculiar people unto himſelf. Therefore if thou haſt any thing farther to accuſe us of, whereby thou canſt prove againſt us ſuch a dreadful charge, as the Treading under our Feet the Blood of the Covenant, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Bring it forth againſt us, or otherwiſe thou (by this) wilt be farther manifeſted to be a falſe Accuſer, and ſo ſhame will take hold of thee, who has gone about this Iſland in divers places, accuſing us with Mallicious accuſations, <hi>viz.</hi> That we had committed the un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pardonable ſin, even the ſin againſt the Holy Ghoſt, and now haſt not been aſhamed to bring it to the Publick view in Print, and yet had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing Juſtly to lay to our charge of any Evil, but a heap of lies and falſe Accuſations.</p>
                  <p>And thou thy ſelf in the 21ſt Page of thy Book, ſaid, I did confeſs to the ſame Jeſus whom the Jews Slew, and God raiſed again from the Dead, where he ſaith, by this confeſſion, <hi>I did openly declare my ſelf a Chriſtian, and no Quaker.</hi> And yet this pleaſes him not, but immediate<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſaith, that by this confuſion, I had contradicted what I contended for before; who never denyed the Man Chriſt Jeſus, no more then the Saints of old, who confeſs to his inward manifeſtation, or Spiritual ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance within.</p>
                  <p>But ſtill this falſe Accuſer <hi>S. B.</hi> goes on with his falſe charges againſt me, takeing up a report from one <hi>Bethel,</hi> who ſaid (in publick) that I told his Wife, <hi>that if ſhe believed in any other Chriſt then that which was within Her, ſhe was Damn'd.</hi> This Accuſation I denyed, (as thus de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clared) which now in his Book, he makes a large report of the ſame, and ſaith, <hi>that I know they were worthy to be believed before me.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> What their Reputation is, I leave at preſent, only this I de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare was falſe as then declared, farther it was ſaid, that I charged Her with Blaſphemy. The truth is, I do not remember I ſpoke one Word to Her at that time, as to charge Her with Blaſphemy: But I
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:151551:34"/> being diſcourſing with Her, and ſpeaking ſomething about the inward appearance of Chriſt in Man, ſhe was ready (I perceived) to Judge (as this Her teacher doth,) that I had denyed the Body or Man Jeſus, and declared of another Chriſt, whereupon ſhe immediately ſtarted up clapping Her hands together expreſſing theſe words, (I pray God I may never be ſaved by that Chriſt within) whereupon I ſaid, <hi>then truly thou muſt be Damn'd,</hi> for if Chriſt be not within the Apoſtles, ſaith, they are Reprobates. Theſe were the very words I ſpoke, not at all denying the appearance of Chriſt in Body.</p>
                  <p>So His and their Lies, and falſe Reports, I leave at their own door, knowing that a day of Account will come, when the Lord will bring the Hidden things of Darkneſs to Light, and will paſs Judgment in Truth and Righteouſneſs.</p>
                  <p>As for the reſt of the matter in that Page contained, about queſtion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing with me about Heaven, I do not remember any thing of it as he has laid it down, only this I remember, that upon ſome queſtion demand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed. I anſwered, <hi>that I did believe Chriſt was in Heaven,</hi> to which, <hi>George Baſ<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ome</hi> or <hi>Laurance Dill,</hi> anſwered, <hi>that I would deny it again to Morrow:</hi> So that anſwer aroſe from that confeſſion, rather then the foregoing, as mentioned by <hi>S. B.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now in anſwer to the thing he ſaid, I charge on him, <hi>viz.</hi> that he had not mentioned Chriſt as God, in the work of Mans Salvation, <hi>Samp<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi>'s Bond in his anſwer ſeems to affirm, that the Apoſtles, (although they knew that Chriſt was God as well as Man, yet they Preached up the Man only to be believed in for the Remiſſion of ſins, both to the Jews and Gentiles, and ſaith farther, that the Apoſtles do Joyntly Teſtifie of the (Man) <hi>Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth <hi>to be the (only) Lamb of God that taketh away the Sins of the World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Reply.</hi> I anſwer to the former part, although the Apoſtles in their firſt going out to preach Chriſt to the <hi>Jewiſh</hi> People, did mention the Manhood, yet this did not at all Argue, that he muſt not believe in, as God, for the Remiſſion of Sin, for as I have ſaid before (to the ſame purpoſe,) there was ſufficient cauſe for them ſo ſtrongly to contend with that people, who had the Scripture, and by the Scripture did underſtand that there was a mighty Prince to ariſe of the ſtock of <hi>David,</hi> that ſhould fit upon his Throne, and Reign over the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Apoſtles might therefore Judge in themſelves, that it would be in vain for them to Preach to the <hi>Jewes</hi> of the Inviſible Glory of Chriſt, till this Scruple were removed, <hi>viz.</hi> whether Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> were the promiſed <hi>Meſſiah,</hi> yea or nay.</p>
                  <pb n="65" facs="tcp:151551:34"/>
                  <p>So I ſay this was their work, thus to Teſtifie of him, and then it right<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly falls in, after they were brought to believe that this was really he that ſhould come, and that they were not to look for another, and that this King was cut off by ſuch an Ignominous Death, (I ſay,) it did then rightly fall in, to Teſtifie and declare, and to give them an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding what manner of King he ſhould be, over what People he was to Rule, as alſo what manner of Kingdom it ſhould be, <hi>viz.</hi> a Spiritual King, a Spiritual Kingdom, and a Spiritual People, even Spiri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tual <hi>Iſrael.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But when the Apoſtle wrote of Chriſt to the believing <hi>Romans,</hi> he declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him as God Bleſſed for ever as well as Man, <hi>Rom.</hi> 9.5. Alſo he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clares him the Lord from Heaven, the quickning Spirit, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. He calls him the Second <hi>Adam,</hi> the Lord from Heaven, and whom <hi>Paul</hi> was firſt ſent forth to Preach, <hi>Act</hi> 26. He was ſent to turn Men from Darkneſs to Light, and from the Power of Sathan to God, by all which it appears plainly that it was never the work of the Apoſtles, nor of any of Chriſts true Miniſters, to Preach Chriſt to be believed in for the Remiſſion of Sins, as Man only without the God-head, <hi>Therefore what God hath Joyned together, let no Man put a ſunder.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Whereas <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, that the Apoſtles bore a Teſtimony joyntly to the Man, that he was the (only) Lamb of God that taketh away the ſins of the World. No <hi>Quaker</hi> denys that.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>John</hi> ſpeaking of Chriſt, ſaith, <hi>He was prefered before him,</hi> for (ſaith he) <hi>He was before me.</hi> Now if he had ſpoke of Chriſt barely as Man, then <hi>John</hi> would have been found a falſe witneſs of Chriſt, for as Man, <hi>John</hi> was ſix Months before him as to his Age, as may appear in <hi>Luk.</hi> 2. So he that but a little before charged me, with bely<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Holy Evangeliſt, <hi>John</hi> himſelf is fallen under the condemnation, and I am clear of his charge.</p>
                  <p>Having thus Traced <hi>S. B.</hi> through his four Arguments, frained to prove his firſt Charge, and given to each of them a particular anſwer, ground<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed upon plain Scripture, Truth and right Reaſon agreeing thereto, and his many falſe and Slanderous accuſations brought fourth againſt me and the Light by me believed in, with his Mallicious reproachful Lies and Blaſphemies, againſt the appearance of God in the Creature, and given anſwer thereto.</p>
                  <p>I intend now (God willing) to paſs forward, to note his following Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gularities, he having to do with other Friends as well as my ſelf, <hi>viz.</hi> The <hi>Lyes, Slanders, Mockings, Blaſphemies,</hi> and <hi>Falſe Interpretations</hi> of the <hi>Scripture;</hi> and to give Anſwer to the ſame, as I ſee occaſion: not
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:151551:35"/> intending a large diſcourſe upon each particular: But as it were to note here and there; as I ſee a neceſſity, to lay open his Deceit, thereby to clear the Truth, and Friends falſly charged.</p>
                  <p>And now to begin with his firſt work following, in <hi>pag.</hi> 24. he ſaith, <hi>William Bullock</hi> (whoſe name by him is miſtaken) his name is <hi>Stephen Bullock) was the next Diſputant, who mentioned the firſt of the</hi> Rom. 19. which he ſaith, <hi>doth not at all anſwer the preſent matter by way of proof, to prove the</hi> Saviour <hi>within to be the</hi> True Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Now here mark how this Interpreter, in his Interpretation of this Scripture, doth make uſe of one word, <hi>viz. Shewed it to them in the Text,</hi> which ſeemed moſt fit for his turn, not only to confound, but quite to race out the other, <hi>(Manifeſt in them)</hi> as if it had never been Inſerted, that thereby it might not prove that, for which (I judge) this Scripture was brought to prove the inward Manifeſtation of Chriſt, as God who is Truth it ſelf, even as Chriſt ſaith, <hi>I am the Way, the Truth, and the Life.</hi> Now in the foregoing verſe, the <hi>Apoſtle</hi> ſaith, <hi>The wrath of God is Revealed from Heaven, againſt all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ngodlineſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs of Men, who hold the Truth in <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteouſneſs:</hi> Mark! here is a Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion that holds the Truth in Unrighteouſneſs, (and thus he clears it up) becauſe (ſaid he) that which may be known of God is manifeſt in them, <hi>viz.</hi> in theſe unrighteous Men, but is it not hid in them, nay, it is manifeſt in them, for he hath ſhewed it unto them. Now this word [unto] this Prieſt hath mad uſe of, to overthrow the true ſence of the word [in] ſo that by this his interpretation, having raiſed out the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal manifeſtation, or inward Teaching of Gods Spirit in the Heart, he hath only ſet up an External Teacher without, <hi>i. e.</hi> the Viſible Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation without, by which only, neither he, nor the wiſeſt Man in the World, by all their Craft, School-Learning and Fleſhly Wiſdom, are able to attain to the knowledge of the Inviſible God, as it is written, 1 Cor. 1.21. <hi>The World by Wiſdom knew not God,</hi> but this Apoſtle witneſſeth that they, <hi>viz.</hi> that wicked Generation had known God, but did not like to Retain him in their knowledge, <hi>verſ.</hi> 28.</p>
                  <p>So then if the true knowledge of God cannot be Attained too by the Wiſdome of this World (which is not able to ſearch into the Miſte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries of the Viſible things,) as is plain by the Apoſtles words in the forenamed, 1 Cor. 1.17. <hi>The World by Wiſdom knew not God,</hi> then its clear, that they had another Teacher, that Informed them in the know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of God beſides the Viſible Creation.</p>
                  <p>The next Scripture this ſaid Prieſt undertakes to open, is in Page 25. <hi>John</hi> 6.63. <hi>The Fleſh profiteth nothing, it is the Spirit that quickeneth:</hi>
                     <pb n="67" facs="tcp:151551:35"/> About the Interpretation of which he ſeems to be greatly confounded, not knowing what Fleſh that is that profiteth nothing, and what Fleſh that is, that is the Souls Food, that came down from Heaven, of which if any Man cat he ſhall live for ever: So having oppoſed the pure Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Light, who is the Saints Teacher, he himſelf is left in the Dark, with which his own deceived Heart is Darkned: So though he ſaid theſe Scriptures did not appear to Anſwer the matter in Hand, yet they are of good ſervice to make manifeſt the Darkneſs of the Man.</p>
                  <p>And whereas Chriſt ſaith, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickeneth,</hi> after <hi>S. B.</hi> in his ordinary manner of turning and winding of that word, at length brings forth this concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> though the Spirit be the Dead Souls quickner, yet it is not the quickned Souls Saviour.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Rep.</hi> To me this ſeems as ſtrange, and as Dark, and as confuſed a Sentence, as ever I heard expreſſed, by one that pretended himſelf a Wiſe-Man: But herein is the Scripture fulfilled: <hi>Job</hi> 5.13. <hi>He taketh the Wiſe in their own Craftineſs:</hi> For it ſeems very ſtrange to me, that any Man ſhould be ſo Dark as to conclude, that that Spirit that giveth Life, doth not ſave from Death.</p>
                  <p>Now Man naturally is Dead, according to the Word of God: <hi>In the Day thou Eateſt thereof thou ſhalt ſurely Dye,</hi> and Death having got an Entrance into the World, through Sin; it paſſed over all Men, becauſe all have Sinned, now Death got Entrance, through the Firſt Man <hi>Adams</hi> offence; and Man now being under the Power of Death; by what means doth Man come to Witneſs Salvation, or Deliverance from Death, but by Chriſt, who is a Quickening Spirit, which giveth Life to the Soul thus Captivated under the Power of Death, which is Chriſt Jeſus the Quick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ening Spirit, which makes the Dead to Live, and ſets free from the power thereof, as is Witneſſed, <hi>Rom.</hi> 8, 2.</p>
                  <p>So this is my Teſtimony for Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Lord from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, the <hi>Quickning Spirit,</hi> who is the Reſurrection and the Life, and raiſes ſuch to Life who are Dead and Buried in the pit of Death and Darkneſs, and makes them to ſit together in Heavenly places, in Chriſt Jeſus, ſo I ſay it is he, and he alone who is the Saviour of Mankind; to <hi>S. B.</hi> might ſee if the God of this World had not Blinded his Eye, that the <hi>True, Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Quickening Spirit,</hi> ſaves as well within as without, ſo that this Scripture was not mentioned in vain, but plainly proves the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus in the Saints, to be their Saviour; both by deliver<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them from the Captivity of Sin, and being delivered to preſerve them from the Power thereof.</p>
                  <pb n="68" facs="tcp:151551:36"/>
                  <p>The next Speaker (he ſaith) was <hi>Patience Bullock,</hi> who he ſaid, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pounded a queſtion to him. Whether Chriſt could have ſaved us with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out his being God.</p>
                  <p>His anſwer, he grants it, and ſaith the Godhead gave the Efficacy and excellency to the Manhood, and in the 28th Page, he tells us, that the humane Nature of Chriſt was the only matter of our Salvation, con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradicting the latter by granting the firſt.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>S. B.</hi> what will the reſult of all this be unto thee, will not all thy wicked Blaſphemies againſt the Lord, and thy revilings of the pure Light, and the Dirt and Mire caſt upon the Throne of God in Man, now return upon thine own Head, thy wickedneſs may be ſeen (in this particular,) in many Pages of thy Book, ſometimes calling the Light a Glow-worm, ſometimes a curſed Goſpel within, Page 20. and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quently, the Idol Light within, but eſpecially in Page 15. there thou art found to joyn both, the Light (which we know and is ſure, is a Meaſure of Gods Spirit in Man,) and the Conſcience made tender by it, which is his Throne, in which he doeth chiefly manifeſt himſelf, (I ſay) thou haſt Joyned both together under a reproachful Term, (that Idol Light tender part within) ſo caſting Infamy and reproach at it.</p>
                  <p>So that which thou ſaid of me in Page 5. <hi>viz.</hi> is truly come upon thy ſelf, for thy Throat is an open Sepulchre, caſting out abominable Stinck, and Noiſome unſavory ſcents in the Noſtrils of God and all Godly Men. So with moſt reviling Speeches thou goeſt on, charging the Light with Antichriſtianiſme, and Villany beyond all the Antichriſts that yet hath appeared, which ungodly charge is Recorded againſt thee in Eternal Record, which thou ſhalt as ſurely feel the waight of it up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on thine own Head as ever thou ſpoke it, and ſo I leave thee to the farther Judgment of the mighty God, whoſe Spirit thou haſt Villified.</p>
                  <p>But to proceed to thy Inferrences upon <hi>Patience Bullocks</hi> queſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, Page 29. Let me ask you this queſtion. Art not thou one of thoſe Car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Goſpelers thou ſpeaks of, that reſts in a bare Hiſtorical Aſſent, that the Man Chriſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> is the true and only Saviour, while (ſayeſt thou) they are in no degree partaker of the Divine Nature, for certainly, if thou wert in that Nature, it would manifeſt it ſelf otherwiſe then it hath done, of Inſtance, thy mocking Friends in thy Houſe of worſhip in <hi>Devonſhire</hi> Tribe, calling one of the Friends Checker-work, and when I reproved thee for it, as a thing unbeſeeming thy pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion, thou anſweredſt wantonly, ſaying, why, is not his Name <hi>White</hi> and his Hatt Black, is not that Checkerwork. This is no Fruit of the Divine Nature, which is that which is Heir to the Kingdome, but on
<pb n="69" facs="tcp:151551:36"/> the contrary, it is a manifeſt Fruit of <hi>Iſhmaels</hi> Nature, ſcoffing thee at <hi>Iſaac</hi>'s Son, and the Bond Woman, which is to have no part of the Heavenly Inheritance: ſeveral other things I might Alledge, as truly ga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thered out of thy Book, which I forbear here to mention, and only content my ſelf with ſome of thoſe particulars, Noted by thine own ſelf, as Signs, or Fruits of the Divine Nature, which are a Lively Faith, and a Lively hope, which both theſe do Manifeſt themſelves (where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever they are, by Holineſs and Purity, as we may Read in <hi>Acts</hi> 15.9. <hi>How that the Gentiles who Lived in the Heatheniſh Nature, when they come to Receive the true and Living Faith, it manifeſted it ſelf by Purifying the Heart;</hi> and this is a certain Truth, <hi>where the Heart is Purified, the Hands will not be Defiled.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And in 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.3. The <hi>Apoſtle</hi> gives a certain and undeniable Cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racter of a Lively hope, ſaying, <hi>Every Man that hath this hope in him, Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rifieth himſelf, even as he is pure:</hi> And in the 9 <hi>ver.</hi> Speaking of this Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, ſaith, <hi>He that is Born of God Sinneth not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>So now compare thy ſelf with theſe Teſtimonies of the Saints in Ages paſt, and ſee if Thou can bring forth ſuch a Teſtimony of the true Divine Nature in thy ſelf: If Thou ſhould ſay, Thou could, Thy Book would ſtand as a Teſtimony againſt Thee, eſpecially toward the latter end, where Thou art found to contend with all thy Might, for Sin, (the Devils Kingdom) that Men cannot be free as long as they are in the Body.</p>
                  <p>Now then tell me, where is thy living Faith, and lively Hope thou ſpoke of? and art thou not then one of the Carnal Goſpellers thou ſpoke of?</p>
                  <p>And whereas <hi>S. B.</hi> ſeeks to caſt this upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> he hath fallen exceedingly ſhort of his purpoſe, for we are not the Men that ever ſaid, the Graces or the Effects, or opperations of the Spirit within, is the true Chriſt and our only Saviour, (as thou chargeſt us) but our true Saviour is he, from whom thoſe Graces and Effects come, and by whom thoſe Opperations are wrought in us.</p>
                  <p>And ſeeing Thou wert ſo exceedingly miſtaken, that Thou didſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand indeed (as by Thine own Confeſſion) that we did make the op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perations of the Spirit of God within us, (which thou calleſt the effects or Graces of the Spirit) to be our True and Only Saviour. How dareſt Thou then, ſo Wickedly to Villifie the Graces, Effects and Opperations of the Spirit of God and Man (if we had been ſo miſtaken) with ſuch Ungodly, Blaſphemous, Infamous Terms or Expreſſions, as in many places in thy Book are found as <hi>Antichriſt;</hi> Curſed Goſpel within <hi>Idol-Light, Glow worm, Familier, &amp;c.</hi> How canſt Thou eſcape the Judgment of the
<pb n="70" facs="tcp:151551:37" rendition="simple:additions"/> Righteous God; for the Lord hath found Thee out, and Thine Enmity againſt his Spirit is now diſcovered; thy covering is found to be too ſhort and too narrow, for thou art not covered with Gods Spirit; Thine own Pen hath diſcovered thine own Shame, and the Lord will make the People to ſee it, even as many whoſe Eyes he ſhall open, and thy words ſhall be thy Burthen in the day of the Lord, for the time draws near that the Lord will Reckon with thee, he doth but wait till thy Cup is full, and then he will Smite and not ſpare, except in the mean time thou do Repent.</p>

                     <p>The next Scripture (he ſaith) mentioned by me, was 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6.11. <hi>We be to prove Chriſts Inward Manifeſtation in the Heart, to Sanctifie and ſave Man from the Power of Sin, but ye are waſhed,</hi> &amp;c. where (he ſaith) <hi>I Craftily omitted (in the Name of the Lord Jeſus) to abuſe their Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, to make them believe Juſtification in the Sight of God, is a work of the Spirit within us:</hi> which I can ſee no other, but that he would have the work of Juſtification altogether without, and nothing of it known within; But miſerable is that Mans condition who hath no better Evi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence of his Salvation then ſo, but muſt needs leave his Aſſurance for another World.</p>
                     <p>In Page 31. Take notice of the confuſion of this Prieſt, who after he hath ſo ſtrongly argued for the work of Mans Salvation, <hi>viz.</hi> that the whole work was perfectly Finiſhed at once (without us) in Chriſts own Crucified Body on the Croſs. Yet now he grants that it is to be wrought within us (not at once) but by degrees, even by the Spirit of God: ſo the work which was ſo perfectly and compleatly Finiſhed before with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out us, yet now it muſt be wrought within us, by the Spirit of God, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it can be effectual to us. This is confuſion with a Witneſs, is not thy whole work overthrown, let the Reader conſider and judge? is it not the ſame thing we have contended for, and is it not the ſame thing againſt which thou haſt hardned thy Heart, and Stiffned thy Neck? Is not this the Spirit of God that works thus Inwardly? that which thou calleſt <hi>The Quakers Pretended Saviour,</hi> which thou ſo often call <hi>The Falſe Chriſt, The Devil,</hi> with many other Reviling, Ungodly, Blaſphe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mous Speeches, or did the Quakers ever pretend to any other Saviour within, then the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus, who is the Light, who is the worker of the things whereof thou Speaks: Well, all this doth Redound to thy own Shame, and will alſo make thy Judgment more then thou wilt be able to bear, except thou ſpeedily Repent.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſwer.</hi> When will thy confuſions come to an end? dideſt thou not ſay but now, that though the Work of Salvation were done at once (without us) yet it muſt be wrought by degrees, by the opperation of the Spirit within, and now I come to bear Reoord to the ſame thing, you cries out, falſe and dangerous Doctrine; who is ſo Blind that cannot ſee thy confuſed Doctrines, who can but Judge thee even Drunk with Enmity, as a Man overcome with Strong-Drink, Reeling this way and that way, and but ſeldome in the Right way, one while confeſſing to the Spirits working within, and by and by denying it again, beſides he doth not only ſay, that it is falſe and dangerous Doctrine, but in Pag 32. he tells wherein, ſaying, it plainly denies the one Propitiatory Sacrifice of the one Crucified Body of the Man Jeſus Chriſt: Immediately (after his uſual manner) breaking forth in reviling expreſſions againſt the Light, calling it unbloody Redeemer, Idol-Light, and the <hi>Pope,</hi> in all which his Enmity is greatly manifeſted againſt the Graces, Effects, and oppera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of the Spirit within, which (he ſaith) in page 29. the <hi>Quakers</hi> make their true and only Saviour.</p>
                     <p>The next Scripture words mentioned by Friends was, as he ſaid by <hi>Stephen Bullock,</hi> Rom. 8.2. <hi>The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death;</hi> which was brought to prove that the Spirit of Chriſt in Man did ſave from Sin, and although the Scripture was clear in it ſelf, yet it appears, he would have ſome Argument framed by the Friend, who not anſwering imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately (<hi>Iſmael</hi> like, the Mocker, who Mocked at <hi>Iſaac,</hi> the Figure of the true ſeed) he broke forth in a Mock, ſaying, <hi>Long faſting parhaps hath made him ſo Empty.</hi> Note, this was the Friend that gave forth the Challenge to try their God by Faſting.</p>
                     <p>By this Scripture, <hi>i. e. The Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus, hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death;</hi> he ſaith, that the Apoſtle doth not mean, that the Spirit did ſo <hi>free him from Sin and Death,</hi> as that he was ſimply delivered from either, but ſo that it ſhould not Dominere over us, nor Damn us.</p>
                     <p>Suppoſe it were ſo that we could grant him this, yet ſtill the Scripture ſtands on the Spirits ſide, (and ſo conſequently on our ſide againſt this Prieſt, for if he doth ſave but from the Dominion of ſin, that is no ſmall
<pb n="72" facs="tcp:151551:38"/> degree of Salvation, ſo by Right and good Reaſon, the Spirit was in <hi>Paul</hi> as a Saviour, and made him free, which if this could be proved, that the Spirit of Chriſt was ever in any Man as a Saviour, thou ſaidſt thou wouldſt give up the Cudgels. But it is plain that <hi>Paul</hi> became Dead with Chriſt, Crucified to the World, Dead to Sin, and Alive to Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſneſs, and all this through the inward working of the Spirit of Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Farther he Ignorantly affirms, that the Death <hi>Paul</hi> was Delivered from, was nothing elſe, but the Power of a Natural Death; here Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple may behold the Ignorance of the Man, was it a Natural Death that <hi>Paul</hi> ſo much complained of? <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.24. Was it not the Body of Death, the Old corrupt Nature, which was not yet quite overcome, yet the Law or Power of this Body of Death was ſtrong in his Mem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bers, and this was it, that he cryed for deliverance from, and that was it from which that Law of the Spirit of life ſet him free.</p>

                     <p>Farther this <hi>Bond,</hi> after his uſual manner of wreſting the Scripture, goes on to comment upon another Scripture, alledged by one of the Friends, <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.13. <hi>But all things that are Reproved, are made manifest by the Light,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
                     <p>Which by Light (he ſaith) we are to underſtand, a ſin Reproving Light, which he farther ſaith, is the Light of the Scripture.</p>
                     <p>But where doſt thou find the Scripture called a ſin reproving Light, we read indeed in <hi>Timothy,</hi> that it is profitable for Reproof and Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, to make the Man of God perfect, and to Furniſh him throughly to every good work, but though it be ſerviceable to reprove the Actual Sinner, what is this to the manifeſtation of ſin in the Heart, before it breaks forth into Action, which only is made manifeſt by the Light or Spirit of Chriſt, as in <hi>Joh.</hi> 16.8. and whereas he ſaith, the Scripture is frequently deſcribed by Light, alledging for proof, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.105. <hi>Thy Word is a Light unto my Steps.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>To this I anſwer, that (Scripture) is not there mentioned. If he ſay it is the Word, to this I farther give anſwer, that the Scripture in no place calls it ſelf the Word, though <hi>S. B.</hi> without any Scripture ground, calls it the Written Word, but it ſaith, God is the Word, and Chriſt is the Word, and <hi>Ezekiel</hi> ſaith often, <hi>The Word of the Lord came unto me, ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing,</hi> ſo that it notes the Word, and the ſayings, which ſayings are (ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny of them) Recorded in the Scriptures of Truth, and are properly the true ſayings of God, who is the Word, <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.1. He farther to confirm the Scripture to be the Light, doth Note, <hi>Joh.</hi> 3.16. <hi>Every one that doeth Evil hateth the Light:</hi> But experience tells us, that every Evil Man doth not hate the Scripture, but delight (many of them) to Read it, and Teach it their Children, but their Enmity is againſt the Light, that makes manifeſt ſin and Iniquity in the Heart, which is the Righteous Principle of God in the Heart, the ſure Word of Propheſie, to which the Saints of Old did take heed, which is prefer'd
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:151551:39"/> before the ſound of Words without, for the Words without may be falſly Tranſlated, and the true ſenſe of them may be changed, and falſly Interpreted, or written in another Tongue, or the Scripture (being made up of ſeveral Creaters) it is poſſible it may be deſtroyed, but the Inviſible Word, the Light (Chriſt Jeſus) could no Man deſtroy, whom the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> ſaith, ſpeaketh from Heaven, Gods beloved Son whom we are to hear, not rejecting the Scripture as it is truly Read, for it bears witneſs to the Light Chriſt Jeſus.</p>
                     <p>Several more Lies, and falſe accuſations I meet with in his Book, as page 38. (he ſaith) the Teaching <hi>Quakers</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is manifest in their real Fleſh,</hi> but the Fleſh of (Chriſt) was only in ſhew and ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearance. And in page 38. he charges <hi>William Harriot</hi> for ſaying he de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nyed their out-ſide Chriſt, which words I do not remember in the leaſt, neither do any Friend or other People that I have ſpoke withal, wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs any ſuch word ſpoken by him.</p>
                     <p>And in page 40. he Proceeds farther with his falſe charges, ſaying, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>deny that Christ was true Man, conſiſting of Body and Soul,</hi> (which is another Lie) and in the ſame page, he ſaith, <hi>A teaching</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ker <hi>doth deny Jeſus to be the Chriſt,</hi> and therefore a Teaching <hi>Quaker</hi> is a Lier and an Antichriſt.</p>
                     <p>O thou ſhameleſs Man! when wilt thou ceaſe to caſt Dirt at Gods Herritage? when wilt thou ceaſe to accuſe the Innocent? whom doſt thou think to Harm, by thy Slanders and Evil aſperſions, for they re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon thine own Head, and that moſt juſtly, for thy Nakedneſs is hereby uncovered to thy ſhame, yet canſt thou not ceaſe, but ſtill goeſt on to defame thoſe Innocent People whom the Lord loves and delights in, even thoſe whom thou diſdains, whom the Lord hath Begotten his own Image in, even thoſe doeſt thou accuſe to be of the Dragon and Beaſt, and to be contradicters and Blaſpheamers.

                     <p>Another Grand accuſation <hi>S.

                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> Though it be certainly true, that the Faithful People called <hi>Quakers</hi> do uſe the Words (thee and thou) to a Singular, yet it is moſt falſe to ſay, that we do it for that End, to deny all Reverential Reſpects to all ſorts of Men, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>In denyal of this his falſe Accuſation, I do here Teſtifie (in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence of God) that when I firſt took it up, it was in the true tenderneſs
<pb n="75" facs="tcp:151551:39" rendition="simple:additions"/> of Conſcience, and in obedience to the Inward requirings of Gods Spirit in my Heart, who required obedience of me: And when I firſt uſed the word to my Superiours, it being in the Infancy of Truth in this Iſland, and People had not been uſed to ſuch a manner of Speech, and my ſelf having been accuſtomed to ſay you to a particular Perſon, it became an exceeding great Tryal, ſo that if I could have had Peace where I ſtood, I believe I ſhould not have Submitted, but it was Manifeſt that it was the practice of the Saints in all Ages of the World, to the end of the Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mitive times, ſo that this manner of Speaking [you] to a Singular Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, came up under the Reign of <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> in the Dark Night of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtacy,</hi> in which State I ſtood as well as many more, but when the Lord was pleaſed to begin to Rend the Vail that was over the Hearts of People, and the Morning Star aroſe, and the day of Chriſt began to break forth moſt clearly, then the Lord was pleaſed to begin to open mine Eyes, and I ſaw (among the many things that then appeared to be parted with) that this was one that I muſt part with, and I muſt come to the plain Language, which the Saints were in, in Ages by paſt, every one Speaking Truth to his Neighbour; otherwiſe I muſt part with Truth it ſelf, ſo I was even conſtrained to take up the Croſs in the ſelf denial, otherwiſe I ſaw I could not be Chriſts Diſciple.</p>
                     <p>So that this is another Slander againſt the Innocent, tending to the Filling up of <hi>S. Bonds</hi> Cup, to make way for Gods wrath to be Execu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted upon him.</p>
                     <p>For this I know, the Saints Leader is one, and Leads in the Path of Humility, all that do truly obey him; and in Humility I took up this Practice and not in any Pride, (the Lord knows) but can as truly give Magiſtrates their due a<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                        </gap> ever, always having an Eye to Conſcience, to keep that undefiled, that the Lord may have firſt his due: So the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour belonging to Men, (to Fathers and Mothers) is in the Lord, and this is right, and according to the Goſpel order. <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.1.</p>
                     <p>Now <hi>S. B.</hi> in his mannageing of this aſſertion againſt us, he lays down his Foundation thus, that (thee and you) (you and thou) are not always in Scripture, of diſtinct ſignification, but are ſometimes of the ſame ſignification, and to prove this, he names, <hi>Lev.</hi> 19.12. <hi>Ye ſhall not Swear by my Name Falſly; Neither ſhalt thou prophane the Name of thy God;</hi> and to this adds, <hi>Jer.</hi> 3.12. <hi>Return thou Back-Sliding</hi> Iſrael, <hi>and I will not cauſe mine anger to burn forth againſt you.</hi> Reply, Take notice of the Subtilty of this Crafty Prieſt (he not being willing to come to the true Language, neither being able himſelf to bear it) he ſeeks to Blind the Eyes of People, that ſo he may keep them in their Sins, by perſwa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:151551:40"/> them that God himſelf puts no difference (ſometimes) between the words, but makes them both of one ſignification.</p>
                     <p>And thus he ſeeks to Blind People (perverting or hideing the true ſence of the Scripture, and putting upon them a ſence beſt pleaſing to himſelf, for the carrying on of his intended deſign.</p>
                     <p>But for all that thou haſt ſaid, or all that thou haſt yet farther to ſay, ſhew me but one Scripture in all the Bible, where the Lord or any one particular Saint ever made uſe of this word [you] to any one particular Perſon, where there was no more (at leaſt) included; otherwiſe thy Argument will fall to the Ground, like an old Building whoſe Founda<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion is Rotten, and as in reaſon to uſe the word (thee or thou) to many, is Ridiculous among Men, they being evermore proper to the Singular number, and altogether improper to the Plural; So on the other hand [you] being formed of [yea] the Second Perſon in the Plural Num<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber, is likewiſe Ridiculous to be put to the Singular. And as to the Scriptures by thee mentioned, (according to the true Sence of them) the plain Language is not at all confounded, neither is the words (thou or you) at all uſed out of their proper place, but each bears its own proper diſtinction and ſignification, for when the Lord ſpeaks to the Mul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>titude of the Sons of <hi>Jacob,</hi> as to many (as it is written) <hi>I will Multi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ply thy Seed as the Stars of Heaven)</hi> then he uſes the word [you] but when he Speaks to his People in a particular or ſingular Sence, as to one Houſe, the Houſe of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> or to one particular Nation, he makes uſe of the word [thou, or thee] ſo the Scripture ſtands clear from <hi>S. Bonds</hi> falſe Interpretation, and the plain Language among Men unconfounded.</p>
                     <p>So this practice, it is agreeable both to Scripture, Precept, Example, and Right Reaſon.</p>
                     <p>But whereas <hi>S. B.</hi> would make his Hearers believe that the Ancient Saints did uſe it only as moved by the Spirit (it is true the Spirit al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways moves Men to Speak Truth) but let him ſhew me in any one par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular, were they did uſe any other manner of Communication then [thee and thou] to a particular in their common Diſcourſe: and yet it did no ways hinder them Saints from giving to every one their due, Honour to whom Honour, Tribute to whom Tribute, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Neither were thoſe Saints exalted with Pride, as thou falſly chargeſt us, but Pride doth Manifeſtly appear in thee, who would have all to bow under thee, and put off their Hats (a practice never uſed by the Chriſtians in for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Ages, that ever we Read off) and to bow and ſcrape, and ſuch like, (this its like would pleaſe thee well) and for want of this (I judge) thou art ſo filled with Envy againſt the Innocent, who cannot bow to
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:151551:40" rendition="simple:additions"/> thy proud Spirit, nor cannot reſpect perſons, knowing that it is con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Faith of the Lord Jeſus, and contrary to the Doctrine of the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>He that reſpects perſons commits ſin, and is Judged of the Law as a Tranſgreſſor,</hi> Jam. 2.1.9.</p>
                     <p>And becauſe we cannot thus ſtoop to the proud Spirit, and bow to the Exalted will, who loveſt to have the preminence; therefore it is that thou are ſo filled with madneſs againſt us, calling us a proud People, a People of a ſurely Dumb, Scurvy, Sneaking, Deportment, and Carriage, making us to appear to thy hearers, (or at leaſt to as to many of them as will believe thee) that we were the worſt of Men, but this is no new thing to be reviled, for the Chriſtians in the Primitive times were accounted by the World as the off-ſcowring of all things, ſo we are contented to bear thy Reproaches, Railing and Reviling Speeches, know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing we are not above our Lord, whom thou haſt Reproached with as Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proachful Terms, as thou canſt find to caſt upon us his Servants.

                     <p>But having here an opportunity, I do bear forth my Teſtimony ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Scripture, 1 <hi>Joh,</hi> 5.8. <hi>There are three that bear Record on Earth, the Spirit, the Water, and the Blood, and theſe three agree in one,</hi> ſo that this I believe, that the Spirit, Water, and Blood, do agree in one in their operation, in Waſhing and cleanſing the Soul from ſin, and there is three that bear Record in Heaven, the <hi>Father</hi> the <hi>Word</hi> and the <hi>Holy Ghost.</hi>

                     <p>The next Scripture Alledged (he ſaith) was <hi>Heb.</hi> 10.15. <hi>But a Body hast thou prepared me,</hi> to which Scripture ſeveral of us ſtrictly urged an anſwer, <hi>viz.</hi> who that (me) was for whom the Body was prepared, although (in his Book) he ſaid he anſwered, that it was the God head of the Son, yet I remember very well how he was at that time grevi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ouſly confounded about it, and no other anſwer could we receive from him (at that time) ſo far as I remember, but this, <hi>viz.</hi> by (me) was meant the Body, though urged over and over, though now, after better conſideration, he hath brought forth a ſmoother anſwer in his Book.</p>
                     <p>And whereas in page 49. he ſaith, that the Leading <hi>Quakers,</hi> hath brought forth (in Print) that this prepared Body was prepared in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven, and brought with him into the Virgins Womb, which Body (he ſaith) that they the Leading <hi>Quakers</hi> calls a miſtical, Inviſible, Spiritual, Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venly Body of Fleſh and Blood, and that the miſtical Inviſible Body, is the true and only Saviour, whoſe Birth, Death, Reſurrection and Glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification is (only) Miſtical and Inviſible.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> I am perſwaded, if this Prieſt had known any <hi>Quaker</hi> that had ſo written as concerning that prepared Body of the Son of God, he had not ſo little Enmity in him, but he would have brought forth his Name or Book, whereby it might have been made manifeſt, but in as much as he hath done neither, I return it back upon him again as an Imagination forced upon his own Heart.</p>
                     <p>And as for that of <hi>George Fox,</hi> concerning the Nature of Chriſt, that it was not humane, but Divine, I have bore my Teſtimony agreeable thereto before, and ſo leave <hi>S. B.</hi> to prove it by the Scripture, which lies upon him as a neceſſity, in as much as he hath laid it down as a neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry point of Faith.</p>
                     <p>One thing more, of which he chargeth the Faithful Servant of the Lord <hi>G. F.</hi> is, that he hath abuſed the Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.11. For we which live are always delivered unto Death for Jeſus ſake, that the Life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our Mortal Bodies.</p>
                     <p>Now the abuſe charged on <hi>G. F.</hi> is, that he reads it thus, the Life of Jeſus is manifeſt in our Mortal Bodies, thereby making that preſent, which the Apoſtle makes future at the Reſurrection.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Anſw.</hi> The words [might be] doth not ſo much note the time as the end, wherefore the Saints were always delivered up to Death (even) for that very end, that the Life of Chriſt might be Manifeſt in their Mor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Bodies; all that might Dye to the Fleſh and to the World, and Sin might no longer Live in them, but that the Life of Jeſus might be Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:151551:42"/> in their Mortal Bodies; Now if <hi>G. Fox</hi> witneſſing the fulfilling of this, and did Teſtifie to the ſame, how did he abuſe the Scripture, or be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lye the Apoſtles words, as thou haſt falſly charged him, but it is plain thou haſt wreſted the Scripture, in that thou ſay'ſt it is only at the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurrection, when <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf witneſſed the ſame thing, before he went out of the Body. <hi>Gal.</hi> 2.20.</p>
                     <p>And yet in contradiction Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith in <hi>pag.</hi> 72. that the Body ſhall be raiſed Spiritual, as Chriſts Body of Fleſh and Bones, after the Reſurrection was Spiritual, our Bodies ſhall not be raiſed Natural cor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptible Bodies, but Spiritual Incorruptible Bodies, though the Body of Man be not Natural corruptible or Mortal Fleſh and Blood, and as ſaith unfit for the Kingdom of God, but in the Reſurrection the Body will not be ſo, for it will then be Spiritual incorruptable, immortal Fleſh and Blood; Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> in this hath contradicted himſelf, and is made to con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs the Quakers Principles.</p>
                     <p>And for what thou haſt to charge <hi>Iſaac Pennington</hi> withal, (I believe) he was a Spiritual Man, and was better acquainted with Heavenly things then <hi>Sampſon Bond,</hi> and ſo could ſpeak as he had known, felt, and recei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved them in Spirit, which is a Myſtery to every Natural Man, for the Wiſdom of this World (with all the acquired parts that it can Furniſh the Natural Man withal) cannot know or Receive the things of God, becauſe they are only known and received in the Spirit.</p>
                     <p>But it had been a great point of Wiſdom in this Prieſt to have been ſtill and quiet, and not to ſpeak Evil of the things he knew not, neither underſtood, but he that thus will rail againſt the Light of Chriſt which (the Saints believe in) will not ſpare his Diſciples.</p>
                     <p>Thus have I ſearched over the firſt part of his Book, which concerns his firſt charge, wherein I have noted ſome of the abuſes, Slanders, Blaſphemies, Confuſions, and ſoft contradictions of <hi>S. B.</hi> and (according to the Meaſure of Light I have Received) briefly anſwered the ſame.</p>
                     <p>I ſhall now paſs on to the Second charge, <hi>viz.</hi> that the main end of the Quakers Meeting in theſe Iſlands, is to make the Lords Chriſt his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Spirit; his Angels and Apoſtles, all Lyers and falſe Witneſſes of God.</p>
                     <p>And to make good this his Ungodly falſe charge againſt us, he lays down this for his Foundation, <hi>viz.</hi> That we are <hi>G. Fs.</hi> Diſciples, and therefore that this is our Principal, that the Light is in us, (which he calls pretended Light, is our true Chriſt, Teacher Rule and Guide, to be heard, believed in, walked unto and obeyed as the only Saviour, to give Remiſſion of Sins and Salvation with God, to which he ſaid we conſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted,
<pb n="81" facs="tcp:151551:42"/> from whence he draws down this concluſion, <hi>viz.</hi> That we did thereby Grant, that the end of our Meetings, is to Teach a denial of Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> the Man approved of God to be our true and only Saviour which Teaching (ſaid he) is to make the Lords Chriſt, his Holy Spirit, his Angels and Apoſtles, all Lyers and Falſe Witneſſes of God.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> The Ground of this his charge, is of the ſame Nature, with the former, becauſe we confeſs to the Spirit within (which is Light) and therefore he concludes that it muſt needs follow, that we do deny the true Chriſt, which he concludes to be the Man Jeſus without, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out having any reſpect to any thing that dwelt within, or (at leaſt) without any Reſpect to the Spirit of Chriſt, whoſe Office it is to cleanſe the Soul from Sin, and ſo conſequently doth ſave and Redeem from under the power of Death.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply.</hi> This his charge is abſolutely falſe, for our Hearts, <hi>viz.</hi> The Hearts of the Faithful amongſt us, is truly ſet to ſerve the Lord, and our main end is truly to Worſhip him in Spirit and in Truth, and if in the Indeavours of our Hearts to bring this our end to paſs, and for want of a true underſtanding in the Scripture, we had miſt of the thing, muſt it needs be charged on us, that it was our main end ſo to do, (I believe) few that have any tenderneſs in them, will believe thee.</p>
                     <p>But on the other Hand, it is Manifeſt that the Man Jeſus did declare himſelf the Light of the World. <hi>Joh.</hi> 8.12. and ſo to be believed in, <hi>Chap.</hi> 12, 46. now as Man barely underſtood how could he be the Light of the World, which Light is a Heart ſearching Light, <hi>Rev.</hi> 2.23. therefore it muſt be underſtood in the Spirit, and he declares himſelf one with the Father, <hi>Joh</hi> 10.30. in whom dwelt the fulneſs of the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head bodyly, who was before <hi>Abraham; John</hi> 8. and it was the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head, the Inviſible power, for which the Body was prepared, and this power dwelling and acting in the Body, was that which unheld it in this great work of Mans Salvation, and it was through the excellency, worth and power of the Indwelling Spirit which was one with the Father, which the Inviſible Eye only could behold, by which the ſatisfaction was made, and the purchaſe of the Heavenly Inheritance obtained, by whom Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of Sins, Juſtification, Sanctification and Everlaſting Redemption is obtained, this is he in whom we confeſs to be our true and only Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viour, in whom we believe. And in as much as he did direct his Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciples, that after his departure, they ſhould wait for his Spirit, which the World could not receive then, no more then they can do now: which (ſaith he) dwelleth with you and ſhall be in you; and this Spirit was
<pb n="82" facs="tcp:151551:43"/> to be waited for, even by his Diſciples that had been taught by him, and he was to be their Guide, and their Inſtructor, and their Leader, and in the Spirit they were to Worſhip the Father, and this is the word of Faith, even Chriſt, the begetter of Faith in the Heart, and muſt be believed in and obeyed, and walked up to, according to his Inward Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons and requirings, which always moveth and leadeth into the things that is good, and maketh manifeſt the Evil, and reproveth for it: and this is not received by Natural Generation, but by the Inſpiration of the Almighty, which is Light, which ſhines in our Hearts, and gives the knowledge of the Glory of God, in the Face of Jeſus Chriſt, and this Spirit, Life and Power dwelt in the Son of God without meaſure: but in the Saints in meaſure; and this is he by which the Saints are Sancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and do receive full aſſurance of the everlaſting unchangeable In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>heritance, and this is wrought by degrees, by the ſame Spirit by which the Saints are continually given up to Death, to dye to Sin, to dye to the Fleſh, to dye to the World, that the Life of Jeſus may be made Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſt in their Mortal Bodies.</p>
                     <p>And the Manifeſtation of this Spirit being given to every Man to profit withal, and we believing that every Man hath Received a Mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure of this pure Light, according to <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. therefore do we direct People to turn in their Minds to this Heavenly Principle, this Heart ſearching Light, that makes Manifeſt Sin and Tranſgreſſion, and leads the Soul out of Captivity, from under the Power thereof, and theſe things we declare and Exhort People to ſubmit unto the ſame, for here<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in only is the true Spiritual Worſhip witneſſed.</p>
                     <p>And now <hi>S. B.</hi> what wilt thou ſay? Wilt thou judge this is to deny Chriſt? or to make him a Lyer, who was truly God? or to make the Holy Spirit a Lyer, to whom we thus Teſtifie? or to make the Angels Lyers, who Teſtified to him as a King whoſe Kingdom was not of this World? or to make the Apoſtles Lyers, who bare ſo large a Teſtimony to his Spiritual appearance, I know and am ſure had thou received thy Meſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſage from the Lord, or ever walked in the Path of the Righteouſs, thou wouldſt have had another Meſſage to declare; then any yet I can ſee come from thee.</p>
                     <p>Now all the Scriptures that <hi>S. B.</hi> brings to prove his charge, they are ſuch as proves the ſame Jeſus to be the Saviour, who was one with the Father; And however theſe Teſtimonies of Chriſt, the Spirit, the Angels and Apoſtles, ſeems to ſpeak of the outward Man; yet thereby we cannot underſtand it any otherwiſe then as he was the Chriſt and
<pb n="83" facs="tcp:151551:43"/> Saviour of the World, who dwelt in the Father, and the Father in him, and the words he Spoke they were not his, but the Fathers that ſent him.</p>
                     <p>But he goes on to Revile the Light, with his common term of Idol, which Idols and Idolatrous practiſes was ever hateful unto God; But the more he Reproaches it, the more he doth heap up Vengeance upon his own Head; to be Executed upon him in the day of the Lord.</p>

                     <p>The Scripture was <hi>Gal.</hi> 4.19. The which Scripture this Reviling Prieſt makes uſe off, to Reproach the (Light) thus.

                     <p>And it is one thing to have this principle in them, and another thing to be in Union with it, it is one thing to have it in a Man, and another thing to be formed into its like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, now none can Witneſs the formings of Chriſt in them, but ſuch as do receive Chriſt (the Light) they, and only they, receive Power to become Children of the moſt High God, even they that believe in his Name, which is the Power, by which Chriſt Jeſus was raiſed up from the Dead, and ſuch who by Faith lay hold on the Power, the Word of Life, the quickning Spirit, by which the Saints are begotten again into Chriſts Nature, and Chriſts own Nature raiſed up in them, and ſo is Chriſts Word fulfilled; you in me and I in you: And thus to know Chriſt is, not to deny the Body which ſuffered and Roſe again, for the Saints which Teſtified of the Man, did alſo bear Witneſs to the Spirit which was their Guide, and Leader, and Inſtructer, and Saviour, and Saved them from the Body of Death, and Power of Darkneſs, and Law of Sin, and Mortified Sin in them, and their Vile affections which were upon the Earth, was Subdued by the Spirit of Chriſt, and they came to know him to be the quickning Spirit, quickning and Enlivening them, and raiſing them up, to ſit in Heavenly places in Chriſt Jeſus, ſo Old things were Wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſed to paſs away, and all things to become new, new Nature, Will new, Aſſertions new, Deſires new, all New.</p>
                     <p>The next thing to be conſidered, is his Ridged ſencering of <hi>Will. Harriot,</hi> with his Fellow Seducers, (as he calls them) Pag. 59, 60, 61. In which he ſhews his Perſecuting Spirit, in paſſing ſuch a Sentance as Whipping, for no other Tranſgreſſion then to deny ſuch

                     <p>And for this, he takes the Scripture for his Rule, <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.13. <hi>And Jeſus went up to Jeruſalem, and found in the Temple thoſe that Sold Oxen, and when he had made a Whip of ſmall Cords, he drove them out of the Temple, and ſaid unto them, make not my Fathers Houſe a Houſe of Marchandice</hi>

                     <p>Now Mark? what ground hath he, or can he rightly gather from hence, to puniſh a Man with Corporal puniſhment, for matter of Judgment and opinion, becauſe he cannot receive his Doctrine, was this, for which they were Whipped, (Judgment or Opinion) was it not rather matter of Fact, and ſo juſtly deſerving Corporal puniſhment, for they were Buying and Se ling contrary to the Law of God.</p>

And here (Mark) he undertakes to know and declare my meaning, meaning (ſaid he) that the Deity (only) was my true and only Saviour) which by adding this Word (only) ſeeks to perſwade People that I deny the Body of Chriſt, but to this I have ſaid ſufficient before, but immediately in a kind of deriding manner, in anſwer to my Words ſaid, <hi>So he is in Catts and Doggs.</hi> Judge, is not that an Irreverent Expreſſion.</p>

                     <p>But here by the way, I cannot but take notice of his expoſition of the words of the Apoſtle, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.16. <hi>Though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet henceforth know we him ſo no more.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>Here he ſaith (Fleſh) is not here taken for the mankind nature of Chriſt; but Fleſh is to be underſtood in this ſenſe, <hi>(viz.)</hi> we muſt know him no more after worldly greatneſs and honour, creature Pomp and Dignity: So this Prieſt ſaith the word <hi>(Fleſh)</hi> is to be underſtood.</p>
                     <p>To which, I anſwer, although the <hi>Jews</hi> did expect the <hi>Meſſiah</hi> ſo to come, this was but their blind imagination: But when was he ever known ſo to come?

B.</hi> hath greatly wronged this Scripture; for he <hi>(viz.)</hi> the Apoſtle, doth ſeem to confeſs that they had known Chriſt after the Fleſh; but ſure I am, they never ſo knew him, as decked with the Glory of this world; for he ſaid, <hi>The Son of man hath not where to lay his head:</hi> So by the Fleſh could not be meant of a fleſhly glory. From whence I thus argue, If Chriſt muſt be known no more after the Fleſh, then he muſt now be known only after the Spirit; or elſe the knowledg of Chriſt muſt ceaſe, for that will truly follow: And if ſo; then the Fleſh of Chriſt as Man, and the Spirit which is God, is truly diſtinguiſhed; ſo God is not the Fleſh of the outward Man, neither is the Fleſh of the outward man God, as this Prieſt doth preſumtuouſly ſeem to affirm, without any true ground of Scripture to maintain his Doctrine.</p>

                     <p>To which (he ſaid) <hi>William Wilkinſon</hi> anſwered, <hi>he had both Baptiſme and the Lords-Supper within him.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>
                        <hi>Reply,</hi> I ſay alſo with <hi>William Wilkinſon,</hi> Baptiſme and the Supper is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in; but for the word Sacrament I deny, it being a non-Scriptural expreſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on. But as to your Water-Baptiſme (as ye now uſe it) it is of your Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther (the Pope) (whoſe Children ye are, while ye obſerve his works and do them) for it neither is, nor never was an Ordinance of God; nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther is there any expreſs Rule in Scripture for it, neither Precept nor ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ample.</p>
                     <p>And farther, I ſay, as to <hi>John</hi>'s Baptiſmes, which was with Water, That was to decreaſe, as <hi>John</hi> did affirm, ſaying, I muſt decreaſe, He muſt in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe, <hi>I indeed Baptiſe you with Water, but he that cometh after me, he ſhall Baptiſe you with the Holy-Ghoſt and with Fire.</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>And as <hi>John</hi> teſtified, ſo it came to paſs; for as the Baptiſme of the Spirit increaſed, ſo that of Water decreaſed; and the Diſciples and Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians (in that day) did not lay ſuch ſtreſs upon the Water then, as ye do now, ſaying. <hi>That it is a matter abſolute neceſſary to Salvation; and Children cannot be ſaved without it, if it might be had:</hi> For <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf, who was not behind the chief of the Apoſtles in Preaching of the Goſpel, what he did in that particular, it is probable he did in his own freedom, having no po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitive command for it; for he ſaid, he was not ſent to Baptize, but to Preach the Goſpel, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 1.17.

                     <p>Now, as the Baptiſme is within, ſo the Supper is within alſo; for we do witneſs Chriſt Jeſus to be come nigh unto our Souls, who is the heavenly Subſtance, the living Subſtance, of which the viſibles were but ſhadows; and now the thing ſignified, the true and heavenly ſubſtance, is poſſeſſed and enjoyed inwardly, by which the Souls of the Faithful are nouriſhed up unto eternal Life; for the Church is in God a ſpiritual Houſe, a ſpiritual Temple, a ſpiritual people; being born a new of the Spirit, and witneſſing a birth brought forth in them, that cannot be ſed nor nouriſhed with ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows; but its meat muſt be Meat indeed, and its drink muſt be Drink indeed, ſuitable to its own Nature, which is Spiritual and Divine.</p>
                     <p>Neither do we (who witneſs the Day of the Lord appeared) feel the Spirit of the Lord, to lead our minds back again into the ſigns and ſhadows, otherwiſe we ſhould be ready to follow, for he is the Saints gu<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Fourthly,</hi> The Prieſt, after an ugodly manner demanded in what part of our Guts Chriſt was? <hi>For</hi> (ſaiad he) <hi>If he be in you, he muſt be in your Legs, Brains or Guts: and if he were in your Brains, he would teach you more wit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Fifthly,</hi> That <hi>Chriſt was not the Son of God: but as he is Man,</hi> grounded upon Chriſt his Words to the Blind Man; when he demanded of Chriſt who the Son of God was? Jeſus anſwered, <hi>I that ſpeak unto thee am he;</hi> which this Prieſt ſaid was only the Man.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sixthly,</hi> That <hi>in the Reſurrection, vve ſhall riſe again the ſame Body for ſubſtance, Fleſh, Blood and Bones.</hi> But the Quallities ſhall be Changed, ſo that he that dyes a Fool ſhall riſe a Wiſe Man, and he that dyes Crooked ſhall be raiſed Straight: This was an Imagination of his own Brain: For there is no Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture for it.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>Laſtly,</hi> He Demanded, (after an ungodly manner) of <hi>Will. Wilkinſon if God vvere in Hell; vvhether he vvas their Saved or Damned.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Theſe Wicked Erroneous, and Ungodly Expreſſions were uttered by him that day: by which the Wiſe in Heart may Judge what Spirit this Prieſt is of, who is alſo a Teacher of others in <hi>Burmudus.</hi>

                     <hi>SAmpſon Bond,</hi> thou ſaiſt in <hi>Page</hi> 14. <hi>That if any Man ſeek to be Juſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the righteouſneſs of the Law, as moſt of the Quakers do,</hi> &amp;c. This horrid Lye and Forgery <hi>S. B.</hi> hath not proved as in <hi>Page</hi> 14. for we being Juſtified freely by his Grace through Redemption that is in Chriſt Jeſus, who dyed for our Sins, and is riſen for our Juſtification, <hi>Rom.</hi> 3. and we are Juſtified by Faith in his Blood: And <hi>as by the offence of one, judgement came upon all men to condemnation; even ſo by the righteouſneſs of one</hi> (to wit Chriſt) <hi>the free gift came upon all men to the juſtification of life,</hi> Rom. 5.18. and a great rabble of this he hath pack'd together in three or four <hi>Pages,</hi> as though <hi>We ſhould deny Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>his Death and Reſurrection,</hi> becauſe we are Witneſſes to the Apoſtles Doctrine, who ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt is in you except ye be reprobates,</hi> 2 Cor. 13. And again, the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>That Chriſt may dwell in your hearts by Faith; and as you have received Chriſt Jeſus the Lord, ſo walk in him,</hi> Col. 2.6. And again the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory whom we preach,</hi> &amp;c. Col. 1.27. Now this is the true Chriſt Jeſus which we own, which the Apoſtle Preach't <hi>IN</hi> people as well as <hi>WITHOUT,</hi> and Chriſt Jeſus who came according to the Promiſe and Prophets of God, and how he died for our ſins accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the Scripture, and that he was buried and roſe again the third day according to the Scripture, and is aſcended at the right hand of God, and manifeſt, and dwells in the hearts of his people, and <hi>he that hath the Son of God hath Life, and he that hath not the Son of God hath not life,</hi> 1 John 5.12. And thus we and the Apoſtles do own Chriſt within, and we do abhor that lying poyſonous Tongue of <hi>S. B.</hi> who ſaith, <hi>We deny Jeſus of</hi> Nazareth <hi>who was crucified, dead and buried, and roſe again, and ſitteth at the right hand of God,</hi> and yet dwells in his people by Faith; and if Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> do not know Chriſt in him, then he is a reprobate, and then let him conſider who dwells in him, if it be not the Devil and Satan whom he hath ſo often in his mouth: And was not Saul perſecuting Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> in his Members, when he ſaid, <hi>Saul, Saul, why perſecuteſt thou me?</hi> as in <hi>Acts</hi> 9.4. and <hi>Saul</hi> ſaid, <hi>who art thou, Lord?</hi> and he ſaid, <hi>I am Jeſus of Nazareth whom thou perſecuteſt,</hi> Acts 9.5. and <hi>Acts</hi> 22.8. Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> could <hi>Saul</hi> get into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:151551:49"/> to perſecute Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> but in his Members? as thou doſt now in us, and calleſt him a <hi>falſe Chriſt</hi> and a <hi>Devil</hi> as he is in us. And Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> all thoſe Scriptures that thou haſt brought or perverted, and miſap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plied in thy 1, 2, 3, 4 <hi>Pages,</hi> which we ſay he hath brought to prove his falſe Charge againſt us, That Jeſus Chriſt of <hi>Nazareth,</hi> a Man approved of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who is the true Chriſt and Saviour, who died for our Sins, and is riſen again for our Juſtification, who is at the right hand of God, and is the one Mediator betwixt God and Man, even the Man Chriſt Jeſus; we ſay, this true Lord Jeſus Chriſt, who is revealed in us, as he was in the Apoſtles and Saints, he hath not proved to be a <hi>falſe Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Deceiver,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> and an <hi>Antichriſt,</hi> as he wickedly and blaphemouſly ſaith, who hath ſold himſelf to work wickedneſs, and made lies his refuge to corrupt and defile peoples minds withal, and all theſe Scriptures, <hi>Acts</hi> 2. and 4, and 10. <hi>Chap.

But how doth <hi>S.B.</hi> own the true Lord Jeſus Chriſt without, if he doth not own the true Lord Jeſus Chriſt revealed within, who is the Saviour? As the Apoſtles, and the true Chriſtians, in ſcorn called <hi>Quakers,</hi> do: For doth not Antichriſt and Deceivers confeſs Chriſt without as <hi>S. Bond</hi> doth, and call the true Chriſt within, Antichriſt, a Deceiver, and a Devil within his people, and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutes Chriſt in his Members like <hi>Saul?</hi> So Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath proved him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf to be in the Spirit of the <hi>Scribes</hi> and <hi>Phariſees</hi> who profeſt Chriſt to come, and when he was come, they ſaid, <hi>he had a Devil, and by the Prince of Devils caſt out Devils.</hi> And now the true Chriſt is come that dyed, and roſe again, and aſcended at the right hand of God, and is revealed in his people as he was in the Apoſtles, and now this true Lord Jeſus Chriſt who dwells in his people who are no Reprobates, Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> in his falſe, wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, blaſphemous Charge, to prove this true Lord Jeſus Chriſt in his people, a falſe Chriſt, an Antichriſt, a Deceiver, a Devil, in this he hath proved himſelf a Deceiver, and a Reprobate, and no true Chriſtian, but hath ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifeſted his folly and madneſs to all that read his Book.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sampſon Bond</hi> who ſtiles himſelf late Preacher of the Goſpel in <hi>Burmoudas,</hi> who ſaith he had a Diſpute with the <hi>Quakers</hi> in <hi>Burmoudas,</hi> and they did ſay, in <hi>Joh.</hi> 1.9. That <hi>that was the true light which enlightens ever man that comes into the world,</hi> and this Scripture <hi>F. E.</hi> he more eſpecially inſiſted on, <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, to prove Chriſt to be the true Light, and that Light to be the
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:151551:49"/> only Saviour which is in every Man that comes into the World, whence ſaith <hi>S. B. F. E.</hi> Argued, <hi>That the</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour within is the true, and not the falſe Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And <hi>S. B.</hi> anſwers and ſaith, <hi>It is true, that by the Light in that place of Scripture, the true Chriſt and only Saviour is meant.</hi> Here <hi>S. B.</hi> makes a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick confeſſion in Print, and ſaith, <hi>It is true, that by Light in that place of Scripture,</hi> Joh. 1. <hi>the true Chriſt and only Saviour is meant.</hi> So then here <hi>S. Bond</hi> doth confeſs that it was the true Chriſt whoſe Name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> by whom all things was made, and in him was Life, and this Life is the Light of men, and this was the true Light which is the Life in Chriſt, the Word that was made Fleſh, who enlightens every man that comes into the World, <hi>John</hi> 1.9. as in <hi>Page</hi> 8. And in <hi>Page</hi> 10. thou ſaiſt, <hi>As for your Idol</hi> (Light-Chriſt, &amp;c.) and ſcoffingly ſaiſt, <hi>Did ever the</hi> Jews <hi>Crucifie your feigned</hi> God-head-Light <hi>within?</hi> Here thou haſt overthrown thy confeſſion as before in Page 8. who ſaiſt, <hi>It's true, that by</hi> Light <hi>in that place of Scripture,</hi> John 1.29. <hi>the true Chriſt and our only Saviour is meant,</hi> &amp;c. and now thou calleſt him our <hi>Idol Light-Chriſt,</hi> in Page 10. But we tell Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> That Chriſt did not dye as he was God, or his Godhead, but he was Crucified in the Fleſh, and as he was Man, whom we believe and confeſs according to the Scripture, Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> was born of the Vir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gin, who dyed for our Sins, and is riſen for our Juſtification, who is aſcend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at the right hand of God, and is revealed in us his people.</p>
                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou ſaiſt in Page 12. 13. <hi>Theſe Scriptures,</hi> Rom. 10. &amp;c. <hi>the Word is nigh thee, even in thy mouth and heart, that is, the Word of Faith which we Preach:</hi> And further ſaiſt, <hi>I do not apprehend how theſe Scriptures anſwer the Arguments—which proveth a</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour within him to be the falſe Chriſt, the Devil: nor how they prove their pretended Saviour within to be the true Chriſt.</hi> In this, Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou haſt ſhewed thy malice and blaſphemy againſt our Lord and Saviour Jeſus Chriſt, who dyed for our ſins, and is riſen for our Juſtification, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and is revealed in us by his Spirit, and rules in our hearts by Faith, yea, he whoſe Name is called the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God;</hi> and we are not of them who ſay, <hi>Who ſhall aſcend into Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven to bring Chriſt down from thence? or who ſhall deſcend into the deep to bring Chriſt again from the dead; but the Word is nigh us, even in our hearts and mouths;</hi> according to the Apoſtles Doctrine: And ſo we do believe in our hearts, and confeſs with our mouths, the Lord Jeſus Chriſt whom God hath raiſed from the dead, by whom we are juſtified and ſaved.</p>
                  <p>Here the Reader may ſee ſome of Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi>'s filthy, lying, blaſphem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Language, that he hath Printed againſt the people of God called <hi>Quakers, Your Idol</hi> Light-Chriſt, <hi>Page</hi> 10. <hi>Quakers are filled with envy;</hi> and
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:151551:50"/> ſpeak againſt thoſe things which were ſpoken by <hi>Paul, O ſeducing</hi> Quakers, twice over. In <hi>Page</hi> 12. hath <hi>S. B.</hi> uttered theſe horrid Lies, <hi>Did ever</hi> Paul <hi>Preach Chriſt Jeſus till God had revealed his Son in him?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Again, <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>A</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour within to be the falſe Chriſt, the Devil,</hi> Page 13.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. B.</hi> We believe thou art nearer the <hi>Devil,</hi> than thou art the <hi>true Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Saviour,</hi> who rules in the hearts of his people by Faith, <hi>who through death, deſtroys Death, the Devil, the Power of Death; and the falſe Chriſt alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>A</hi> Quakers, <hi>&amp;c. Saviour within is not the true, but falſe Chriſt.</hi> Page 14.</p>
                  <p>Theſe are Lies without proof, and this Lying Spirit that rules in <hi>S.

Col. 27.28. and yet <hi>S.B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>If thou confeſſeſt with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall believe in thy heart that God raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved:</hi> But, <hi>S.

And then thou ſaiſt, <hi>That Idol-Light, tender-part within, which you falſly call the everlaſting Goſpel and Eternal Word,</hi> (as in <hi>Page</hi> 15.) and yet thou confeſſeſt in <hi>Page</hi> 8. that every man that comes into the world is enlightned by Chriſt the Son of God, as he is the <hi>Eternal Word:</hi> And is not the Goſpel the Power of God? And is not that <hi>Eternal</hi> or <hi>Everlaſting?</hi> Rom. 1. Rev. 14.

                     <hi>S. B.—The Eternal Word, which</hi> (as ye affirm) <hi>was never made Fleſh,</hi> page 15. and page 18. thou gives thy ſelf the Lye, when thou ſaiſt, <hi>F.

Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſhould have brought the Scripture, and Chapter, and Verſe for it. God ſaid, Job <hi>was a perfect and upright Man:</hi> But Prieſt Bond ſaith; <hi>Not from Sin in this Life.</hi> David ſaith, <hi>Mark the perfect and upright Man,</hi> Pſalm 37. But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith: <hi>There's no perfect and upright Man from Sin in this Life.</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> brings <hi>Job</hi> the Five and Twentieth, Bildad <hi>the</hi> Shuhite, who ſaid to Job, <hi>How can a Man be juſtifyed with God? Or how can a Man be Clean, that is Born of a Woman?</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſays, <hi>This Queſtion car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries a ſtrong Denial; It cannot Poſſible be, or it is Impoſſible</hi> (viz.) <hi>To be perfect from ſin.</hi> &amp;c. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>As if</hi> Job <hi>had ſaid, do but acknowledge that any one is born ordinarily of a Woman, and we may conclude him to be ſinful and unclean, with (or in the Sight of God;)</hi> ſo far Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> Page 78. But, Reader, did not God ſay Job <hi>was a perfect and upright Man?</hi> And again, Reader, read the 25th. of <hi>Job,</hi> and thou wilt ſee, that it was <hi>Bildad</hi> the <hi>Shuhite,</hi> that contended with <hi>Job,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>How can a Man be juſtify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed with God? Or how can a Man be Clean that is born of a Woman?</hi> So theſe were not <hi>Job</hi>'s words, as Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> baſely would Father upon <hi>Job;</hi> for they were <hi>Bildad</hi>'s Words, who contended with <hi>Job:</hi> and it is like all the reſt of his Pleading againſt <hi>Perfection,</hi> and Pleading for <hi>Sin,</hi> and the <hi>Devil</hi> his Father, the Author of it. And God bid <hi>Araham walk before him and be Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fect.</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>though</hi> Job, Noah, Jacob, Abraham, <hi>are ſaid to be Perfect, yet it is not to be found in the Scripture, that God ever ſaid of all or any one of them, they were</hi> Perfect, <hi>without ſin in the World.</hi> Now is not this Doctrine of <hi>S.

And Chriſt ſaid, <hi>Be you Perfect as your Heavenly Father is Perfect.</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>'Tis an erroneous Principle, that there is an Eſtate of Perfection and freedom from

                     </gap>th, <hi>Deduction of freedom from ſin, (in the Saints in this Life) cannot from hence be drawn.</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Now the State which accompanies the Reſurrection of the Dead, excludes all Sin; The Saints ſhall then be Legally Perfect.</hi> But S. <hi>Bond</hi> has not proved his Doctrine by Scriptures: and what muſt we underſtand by S. <hi>Bonds</hi> Words? <hi>That the Saints which are Sanctified and made Holy while they be upon the Earth, muſt have Sin:</hi> which is of the Devil, and be Imperfect in this Life? Yet the Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtle ſays to the <hi>Philippians</hi> 3. 1 Cor. <hi>Let as many as be Perfect, &amp;c.</hi> Read 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 2.6. Then <hi>S. B.</hi> falls upon his foul Language; <hi>ſeducing</hi> Quakers, <hi>Heretical</hi> Cathariſhes; and ſaith, Solomon <hi>makes a Challenge to all the World,</hi> Pro. 20.9. <hi>Who can ſay I have made my Heart Clean, I am pure from my Sin?</hi> But Solomon tells <hi>Bond</hi> in the ſame Chapter, <hi>The juſt man that walks in his integrity, his Children are bleſſed after him,</hi> and it is the Blood of Chriſt, that Cleanſeth us from all Sin, without him we can do nothing. Again, John 1.1.8. This Proclamature is beyond <hi>Solomon</hi>'s, <hi>If we ſay that we have not ſinned we make Chriſt a Lyar.</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>We that are of the new birth ſay: If we ſay we have not Sin, we deceive our ſelves, and the Truth is not in us.</hi> But this Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> abuſes <hi>John</hi>'s Words, and <hi>John</hi> ſays 1.3. <hi>Whoſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is Born of God, doth not commit Sin, for his Seed remaineth in him, and he cannot Sin becauſe he is born of God: In this the Children of God are manifeſt, and the Children of the Devil.</hi> Now I Querie of Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> Whether there are any born of God whilſt they are upon the Earth? and if ſo, whether they muſt believe <hi>John</hi>'s Doctrine? And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls a Railing;—If the <hi>Quakers ſhould be ſo ſtark mad, as to affirm all the Saints to be free from Sin,</hi> which Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Cannot be meant a freedom from Sin, but only of the Trade and Cuſtom of Sinning.</hi> I charge Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> to bring forth the Chapter and Verſe that ſays, <hi>For his Trade and Cuſtom of Sinning.</hi> But the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>If we ſay we have no ſin, we deceive our ſelves,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And if we Confeſs our Sin, he is faithful and juſt, to forgive us our Sins, and to cleanſe us from all (mark</hi> all) <hi>Unrighteouſneſs. If we ſay we have not Sinned, we make him a Lyar,</hi>
                     <pb n="15" facs="tcp:151551:55"/> &amp;c. So here is a time for people to ſee they have Sinned, and to confeſs their Sins; and <hi>the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son cleanſes from all Sin</hi> (mark <hi>from all Sin.) Joh.</hi> 1. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> makes a great Pudder about <hi>Paul,</hi> who ſaith, O <hi>wretched man that I am, who ſhall deliver me from this body of Death? Paul</hi> tells thee in <hi>Rom.</hi> the 7th. and the 8th. He thanks God through Jeſus Chriſt, and ſaith, <hi>there's no Condemnation to them that are in Chriſt Jeſus, who walk not after the Fleſh but after the Spirit, for the Law of the Spirit of life in Chriſt Jeſus hath made me free from the Law of Sin and Death: And he hath not ſeen iniquity in</hi> Jacob. Now Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> Confounds himſelf, and grants, <hi>That believers may walk in the Commandments and Ordinances of the Lord blameleſs, that is to ſay, Rebukeleſs,</hi> [in regard of Men.] We ſpeak Wiſdom among them which are perfect, meaning however imperfect Weaklings. Doth not <hi>S. Bond</hi> abuſe the Apoſtles words here, and add to the Scripture, Page 85. And again, <hi>That you may be blameleſs and harmleſs, the Sons of God, without Rebuke in the midſt of a crooked and perverſe Nation amongſt whom they ſhine as Lights in the World,</hi> (mark that.) And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith (and Confounds himſelf) <hi>The Phraſe Blameleſs, Simply in its own nature, will be ſo far from proving perfection of Grace, that it will not prove any truth of Grace; it will not therefore follow, that</hi> Elizabeth <hi>was Perfect without Sin:</hi> though Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> Confeſſes ſhe was <hi>blameleſs,</hi> and hath not charged her with what Sin ſhe committed. Doſt not thou confeſs ſhe was <hi>Blameleſs</hi> and <hi>Righteous,</hi> &amp;c. And did not <hi>Elizabeth</hi> Believe? Did not ſhe ſay to <hi>Mary, Bleſſed is he that Believes?</hi> So <hi>Elizabeth</hi> was a Believer, as well as her walking blameleſs in all the Command<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments and Ordinances of the Lord. But <hi>Saul</hi> who was a Blaſphemer and Perſecutor, was no Believer; therefore there's no Compariſon with <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>Elizabeth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>In the Day of Chriſts coming in Glory, the Saints ſhall be found of God in Peace, without Spot and Blameleſs: But not thus in this Life,</hi> p. 85. The Apoſtle ſaith, 1 Cor. 1.8. <hi>Who ſhall alſo confirm you unto the end, that you may be blameleſs in the Day of our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; howbeit we ſpeak Wiſdom among them that are Perfect; for I Brethren could not ſpeak un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to you as unto Spiritual, but as unto Carnal, even as unto Babes in Chriſt,</hi> 1 Cor. 3. Where has Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> learned this Leſſon, that the Saints ſhall not be freed from Sin in this Life? Then how can they be kept blameleſs unto the Day of Chriſt, and not to be kept free from Sin, which is of the Devil? But as <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, page 86. <hi>There is not a juſt Man upon the Earth; Solomon</hi> ſaith in the ſame Chapter, <hi>Be not righteous overmuch, be not overmuch wicked.</hi> So in a Man's own Righteouſneſs and Juſtice he may Sin: But Chriſt Clean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes from all Sin, and doth that which the Law could not do; but Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith page 87. <hi>There is in all true. Believers a curſed Root of bitterneſs,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:151551:56"/> which God doth mortifie, but not nullifie in this</hi> World; 'tis ſubdued, but not removed; 'tis caſt down, but not caſt out: though Grace makes the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bate, yet Death only makes the Conqueſt over Sin.</p>
                  <p>We charge Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> to prove this Doctrine by Scripture, his <hi>curſed Root of Bitterneſs in all true Believers,</hi> and that they ſhall never Conquer it till they Dye: and to prove that this was in <hi>Abraham, Iſaac,</hi> and <hi>Jacob, Abel</hi> and <hi>Enoch,</hi> and in them that the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>We ſpeak Wiſdom among them that are Perfect.</hi> And has not Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> given <hi>John</hi> the Lye, who ſays, <hi>whoſoever is born of God, doth not commit Sin; for his Seed remains in him, and he cannot Sin; becauſe he is born of God,</hi> 1 <hi>John</hi> 3.9. Now let Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> prove, where ever the Apoſtle Preached ſuch a Doctrine, as <hi>in all true Believers there is a curſed Root of Bitterneſs, mortified and not nullified in this World; Death only makes the Conqueſt over Sin.</hi> So we muſt underſtand, we muſt have this <hi>curſed Root of Bitterneſs,</hi> as long as the Believers live, according to Prieſt <hi>Bond's</hi> Doctrine, though he has not proved it by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; and then how can they be kept blameleſs to the Day of the Lord, as in page 85? <hi>Prieſt</hi> Bond <hi>ſaith, 'tis an erroneous Principle for the Quakers to ſay that the Scriptures are not the word of God, in</hi> page 77. and page 87. he brings many Scriptures, and makes a great pudder, and abuſes them, to prove it, but to no purpoſe, his <hi>declarative word of God,</hi> but he hath not proved ſuch a word in Scripture: all Scripture is given forth by Inſpiration of God, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. Therefore ſaith Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> the Scriptures is the word of God, but that Scripture doth not ſay ſo, 2 <hi>Tim.</hi> 3. And in page 88. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls a Railing againſt Quakers, and ſaith, <hi>Is there any word aſſerted to be the word of Chriſt, but the written word of Truth?</hi> Doth not the Apoſtle ſay, that the Word of Faith, is nigh in the heart, let the word of Chriſt dwell in you, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Being born again not of corruptible Seed, but of Incorruptible, by the word of God, the word of God endures for ever; and are theſe Writings of the Letter? And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, page 88. <hi>The Lord hath no other will (as a Rule of Obedience, than his will revealed in the written Scriptures)</hi> had the Lord no other will, or Rule of Obedience before the Scripture was written? Prove that by Scripture. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> runs into Lies, and foul words; <hi>the Quakers worſhip cannot be accepted of God, Quakers are under the power of Satan, groſs, blind, and ignorant, the Cavil is idle and vain.)</hi> Theſe Lyes Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> may apply to himſelf: but where doth the Scripture ſay of themſelves in ſo many words as S. B. doth, <hi>that the Scripiures are the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſtanding Rule of his Faith and Life,</hi> and yet acts contrary to them; for the Scripture ſaith, <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt ſhall lead you into all Truth, and no Man knows the things of God, But the Spirit of God:</hi> and Holy Men ſpake forth Scripture as they were moved by the holy Ghoſt. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls a
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:151551:56"/> railing againſt <hi>Quakers</hi> Spirit, and calls it their <hi>Idol light within, ſeducing Quakers</hi>—is blind: Theſe filthy ungodly words he had better apply to himſelf. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Becauſe the Spirit is antecedent to the Scriptures, therefore none can walk in the Scriptures till they walk in the Spirit. This conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence is lame, ſaith</hi> Bond, <hi>Page</hi> 90. <hi>Howbeit the Scriptures are before the Spirit in reſpect of aid and aſſiſtance.</hi> The Apoſtle doth not ſay ſo, in 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1. The Apoſtle tells you, <hi>The natural man receives not the things of the Spirit of God, for they are fooliſhneſs to him; neither can he know them, becauſe they are ſpiritually diſcerned.</hi> So it is the Spirit of God that brings people both to diſcern the Scriptures, and to walk according to them; which Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God or Holy-Ghoſt was before they were written, which moved the holy men to give them forth. And <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>To the Law and the Teſtimo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny</hi> (the Written Word) he adds <hi>Written Word;</hi> and yet he ſaith, <hi>Scripture is his Rule.</hi> And <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>When the Spirit of Truth is come, it ſhall guide you into all truth of the Scriptures:</hi> And yet he ſaith, <hi>The Written Scriptures are the Infallible ſtanding Rule of Faith and Life,</hi> page 89. 91. And how can the Scriptures be the <hi>Rule,</hi> and the Spirit of Truth muſt be the guide into all the truth of the Scriptures? And again Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> contradicts himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>He affirms, that the matter contained in the Scriptures is the only in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fallible ſtanding rule of Faith and Life,</hi> Page 91. So then the Scriptures are not the only rule, but that which is contained in them: And what is that which is contained in them which is thy Rule, ſeeing the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> was in them, which moved them to ſpeak them forth, and <hi>in them,</hi> that leads them into all the truth of them? But Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> is all the Scriptures from <hi>Geneſis</hi> to <hi>Revelations</hi> thy <hi>Rule,</hi> and all that is contained in them? For the Scripture ſpeaks of the <hi>Devils words,</hi> and bad men's words, as well as the good. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The People of God had no Word Written from Adam to Moſes, and yet they had a Word given from God to be the rule, elſe their wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip would have been</hi> (like the Quakers) <hi>Will-worſhip.</hi> If Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> have not the ſame <hi>Word</hi> and <hi>Holy-Ghoſt,</hi> as they had, he cannot Worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, neither can he be born again of the incorruptible ſeed, but by that Word which lives, and abides, and endures for ever: And <hi>Will-worſhip</hi> is not the Quakers, who worſhip God in Spirit and Truth, but his own. In <hi>Page</hi> 92. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> is full of railing againſt Quakers, their <hi>Idol light within,—craftily thrown down the Scriptures, this Plot cannot be from the Spirit of Chriſt,—blind, rotten and wicked ſpirit,—your Light (that falſe Chriſt within).</hi> See how wickedly <hi>Bond</hi> torments himſelf, and blaſphemes againſt the true Chriſt, and the Light in his people. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Where is that place of Scripture to be found, which ſaith, the Scriptures are to be tryed by the Spirit,—the Spirits are to be tryed by the Scripture, and not the Scripture
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:151551:57"/> by the Spirit.</hi> Then Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> what Scripture had they to try withal from <hi>Adam</hi> to <hi>Moſes,</hi> before the Scripture was written? And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is the Holy-Ghoſt that leads into all truth of the Scriptures.</hi> Then it muſt try the truth of them, whether they be rightly tranſlated or no: And the Spirit of God will not deny its own Words. And again Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Spirit witneſſes in the Scripture.</hi> But where doth the Scripture ſay ſuch words, That <hi>the Spirit witneſſes in the Scripture?</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Spirit witneſſes in the Scripture, that he is a righteous man who walks in all the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandments or Ordinances of the Lord,</hi> page 99. And page 87. Thou ſaith (in contradiction) <hi>There is in all true Believe<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="2 letters">

Then Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls a railing, Quakers <hi>damnable deluſion, helliſh Impoſtor, that Idol light; for if they might herein prevail, and withal get into the Saddle, they would undoubtedly ſoon arreign, try, and condemn the inſpired Bible of God to the Fire and Fagot.</hi> Theſe are horrid malicious Lies, Blaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phemed from Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> evil Tongue: For we have eſteemed, and do own the Scriptures more than he or any of the perſecuting Prieſts in <hi>New-England,</hi> who make a Trade of them, and keep people always under <hi>Teaching,</hi> that they may be always <hi>paying</hi> of them.</p>
                  <p>And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The ſpirits are to be tryed by the Scriptures, and not the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures by the Spirit,</hi> page 92. And in page 93. He contradicts himſelf, and confounds all again, <hi>The Holy and Bleſſed Spirit of God is above all Tryal.</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>We deny the written Scripture to be a witneſs-bearer to your Light within.</hi> See how Ignorant he is of the Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4. <hi>God who commanded the Light to ſhine out of darkneſs, hath ſhined in our hearts to give us the Light of the knowledge of the Glory of God in the face of Chriſt Jeſus:</hi> Mark the <hi>Light that ſhines in the heart,</hi> that is, the <hi>Light within</hi> that the Scriptures bear witneſs too. But I perceive the God of this World hath blinded Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi>'s eye. And how can any man come to the knowledge of God and Chriſt, without the <hi>Light of Chriſt within</hi> ſhining in their hearts?</p>
                  <p>And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls on rayling, <hi>Idol light within,</hi> page 94. <hi>Seducing</hi> Quakers, <hi>Idol light of your own addle brains, Soul-deceivers, ye would lay a foundation of your own humane inventions:</hi> And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> calls Chriſts <hi>Body humane,</hi> which is his own <hi>Invention,</hi> and not Scripture: And <hi>unbloody Light within, Idolized light, hath no more real blood in it, than there is in the Tranſubſtantiated blood of your Popiſh Brethren.</hi> Here the Reader may ſee what a rage and madneſs Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> is in againſt the <hi>Light of Chriſt:</hi> And as for <hi>Popiſh Brethren,</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi>'s language bewrays him, he is nearer to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:151551:57"/> them than the Quakers. And <hi>S.

But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The whimſey, called Light within, is the new deviſed ground of Faith.</hi> Chriſt who doth inlighten every man that cometh into the World ſaith, <hi>Believe in the Light, that you may become Children of the Light.</hi> And Chriſt is the author and finiſher of our Faith; and the Light of Chriſt that he bids us believe in, is no <hi>Whimſey</hi> which Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> blaſphemes againſt.

                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> I would have thee to prove, that the Holy-Ghoſt is <hi>a Perſon</hi> which proceeded from the Father and the Son, and leads into all Truth: And when the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> fell upon the Diſciples in the time of <hi>Pentecoſt,</hi> did it fall upon them as a <hi>Perſon?</hi> And when it fell upon <hi>Cornelius</hi>'s <hi>Family,</hi> did it fall upon them as a <hi>Perſon?</hi> And Chriſt tells the Diſciples, that the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> the Comforter dwells with you, and <hi>ſhall be in you,</hi> John 14. And was this a <hi>Perſon?</hi> Acts 11. Acts 19. <hi>The Holy-Ghoſt fell upon,</hi> &amp;c. So,
<pb n="21" facs="tcp:151551:58"/> where ever did Chriſt or the Apoſtles call the <hi>Holy-Ghoſt</hi> a <hi>Perſon? S. B.</hi> is to prove this Word by Scripture, which he ſaith is his <hi>Rule.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now concerning the <hi>Scriptures</hi> which Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> calls the <hi>Word</hi> of <hi>God,</hi> firſt, doth not the <hi>Scripture</hi> ſignify <hi>Writings?</hi> And do not you teach your Chil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dren ſo, that <hi>Scripture</hi> ſignifies <hi>Writings</hi> in your <hi>Catichiſme?</hi> and <hi>Matthew</hi> the Book of the Generation of Jeſus Chriſt, and Chriſt read in the <hi>Book</hi> of the Prophet <hi>Iſaiah,</hi> and in the <hi>Book</hi> of the Words of <hi>Iſaiah</hi> the Prophet, <hi>Luke</hi> 3, and 4. and <hi>Luk.</hi> 4.17. <hi>Written in the Book of the Law,</hi> Gal. 3.10. and <hi>Written in the Book of the Pſalms,</hi> Acts 1.20. And doth not <hi>Luke</hi> ſet forth a <hi>Declaration?</hi> Luke 1. And ſo doth he not call that a <hi>Declaration</hi> which he ſet forth? and ſo <hi>Daniel</hi> calls them the <hi>Scriptures of Truth,</hi> Daniel 10.21. And <hi>Mark</hi> calls them the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> Mark 12.10. and <hi>Luke</hi> 4.21. Chriſt calls them <hi>Scriptures,</hi> and John 2.22. and in Acts 1.16. The Apoſtle calls them <hi>Scriptures,</hi> Rom. 10.11. and 11.2. The Apoſtle calls them <hi>Scriptures,</hi> 2 Tim. 3.16. James 2.8. 2 Peter 1.20. Acts 17.2.11. Rom. 15.4. 1 Cor. 15.3. Here in all theſe places, and many more, Chriſt and the A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtles calls them <hi>Scriptures,</hi> which ſignifies <hi>Writings</hi> Now <hi>Scriptures</hi> of truth, which ſignifies <hi>Writings,</hi> they are called the <hi>Words</hi> of <hi>God; God ſpake all theſe Words,</hi> Exod. 20. And Chriſt ſaith, <hi>John</hi> 3.34. The <hi>Words of God.</hi> And John 5.47. John 6.62. And John 8.20.47. John 10.121. John 12.47, 48. John 14.10.23.17.8. All theſe are concerning the Words. And <hi>Acts</hi> 2.14.5.20. 1 <hi>Tim.</hi> 4.6.6.3. The words in all theſe places, and many more, <hi>Revelations</hi> 1.3. that hear the words of this pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phecy; and until the Words of God ſhall be fulfilled, <hi>Revel</hi> 17.17. Theſe Words are true, <hi>Revel.</hi> 21.5. Teſtifie ſaith <hi>John</hi> to every Man the words of the Prophecy of this Book, if any Man ſhall take away from the words of the Prophecy of this Book, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> So here you may ſee the Scriptures are called Words, Books, Declarations, and the Writings, and Scripture; and are called the Words of God, and the Words of Chriſt; but Chriſts Name is called the Word of God, <hi>John</hi> 1.8. And again Chriſts Name is called the <hi>Word of God,</hi> Revelations 19.13. So here the <hi>Quakers</hi> own the Scriptures as they have been called by Chriſt and his Apoſtles, and the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets. <hi>S.

                     <hi>reproach the Lord, when they deny the Scriptures to be the Word of God,</hi> Page 88. And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> contradicts himſelf in Page 87. and ſaith, <hi>We do not affirm the Scriptures to be the Word of God, but as the written Scriptures do declare the Mind of God to us.</hi> So here Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> is made to confeſs the <hi>Quakers</hi> principles; but preſently after he confounds it again, and ſaith, <hi>The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture is the Word of God.</hi> And then contradicts himſelf again, and ſaith, <hi>The matter therein contained is the declaritive Word of God,</hi> Page 87. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>the</hi> Quakers <hi>are apt to ſay there is no ſin Charged upon</hi> Zachariahs <hi>Wife, who was Righteous and blameleſs;</hi> but ſaith Prieſt <hi>Bond, Death took hold, as well of her as of him, which is the wages of ſin,</hi> Rom. 6. So what muſt we under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand from Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> words? Here they that put off the Earthen Tabernacle, and dye in the Lord, that natural death is the <hi>Wages of Sin, Rom.</hi> 6.23. But let the Reader ſee how he abuſes the Scripture, for the <hi>Wages of ſin is death: But</hi> ſaith the Apoſtle, <hi>Now being made free from ſin, and become the Servants of God.</hi> This is while they were upon the Earth alive, and is it not a denying of Chriſt that dyed for Sin to ſay that <hi>Death took hold of</hi> Eli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zabeth <hi>as well as</hi> Zachariah, <hi>and ſo upon all other</hi> People (to wit) <hi>a natural death, and that natural death which is the wages of ſin,</hi> as in Page 86. where he perverts Rom. 6. But the Saints and we tell Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> Chriſt dyed for our Sins, and is riſen for our Juſtification; and ſo whether we live or dye we are the Lords; and if we dye we dye in the Lord; and Bleſſed are they that dye in the Lord. Prieſt <hi>Bond, They have a Light of direction from the Law of the Creation, and this Light is clear and full enough to make them Guilty,</hi> in Page 82. But Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> doſt not thou call this Light within an <hi>Idol Light,</hi> Page 90? And where doth the Scripture call the <hi>Light of Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Law of the Creation,</hi> or a <hi>natural Light?</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou ſaiſt in Page 81. <hi>The Gentiles which have not the Law, do by nature the things contained in the Law.

But who writ the Law in the <hi>Gentiles</hi> hearts? and how doth this Light come by nature or generation? prove this by expreſs words in Scripture which thou calleſt thy rule, <hi>Noah</hi> was a juſt and a perfect man, <hi>&amp;c.

And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath not proved in Page 66. his <hi>Baptizing of Children with Water;</hi> and that outward Water is one of the three Witneſſes ſpoken of by <hi>John;</hi> and <hi>W.

Therefore how dare he ſay, <hi>that the</hi> Quakers <hi>deny both the Sacraments?</hi> and hath not proved that outward Water and outward Wine to be a Sacrament; nor the Word Sacrament a Scripture Word? Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the Spirit, as ſuch, never Juſtified any Saint from Sin in the Sight of God, much leſs ſuch as</hi> F.

Doth not Chriſt ſay, <hi>He was not of this World?</hi> He teſtified againſt this World, <hi>that their Works were Evil.</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>All ſuch as ſtand in a Covenant of Works, as</hi> the Quakers <hi>do.</hi> And yet in Page 61. <hi>W.W.</hi> confeſſes to Chriſt, in them the hope of Glory, the <hi>Quakers</hi> are in the Covenant of Grace, the Light and Life, which Light thou Blaſphemouſly calls an Idol, as in Page 64.

And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>Chriſt is in you except you be Reprobates.</hi> But it ſeems Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi>'s Goſpel is not everlaſting: The Apoſtle ſaith it was everlaſting, and ſo do the <hi>Quakers:</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> one while he ſaith the Fleſh is Humane, and another while it is ſpiritual; but whether or no doth Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> eat and drink Chriſts Humane Fleſh and Blood as he calls it? And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>to teach a denyal of Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a man approved of God, to be the true Chriſt and our only Saviour.</hi> This the <hi>Quakers</hi> never did, nor never was in their thoughts to deny, the Lord knows; and therefore Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> cannot charge it upon the <hi>Quakers,</hi> as in page 54. Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou ſaiſt page 53. <hi>that Chriſt is the true Jacobs Ladder,</hi> John 1.51. But let the Reader read <hi>John</hi> 1.51. there is no ſuch ſaying in that Verſe: And thou ſaiſt, <hi>the bottom of which</hi> (to wit) <hi>the Ladder, there is his humanity or vail of fleſh and blood; and the top reaches to Heaven, and there is his Divinity:</hi> But where muſt we find theſe words of Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> in Scripture, which he ſaith <hi>is his Rule?</hi> And where doth the Scripture call the <hi>Blood of Chriſt,</hi> a <hi>Vail,</hi> which cleanſeth from all ſin, and ſprinkles the Conſcience from dead works, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The viſible material body of Jeſus Chriſt is not the Saviour,</hi> &amp;c. page 52. This he charges upon ſome of the <hi>Quakers;</hi> but he hath not quoted the Page where we ſhall find it: So we believe he hath wronged their words. But is the viſible material Body of Chriſt the only Saviour without God? And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith in page 72. <hi>Chriſts Fleſh and Bones, after the Reſurrection, was ſpiritual and im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mortal Fleſh and Bones,</hi> page 75. And he ſaith <hi>viſible and material</hi> in page 52. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith in page 53. <hi>I have often heard ſome of them to af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>firm, that the</hi> Quakers <hi>do believe in Chriſts Body of Fleſh and Blood; and that he dyed for ſin, and roſe again, and that he is mans only Saviour:</hi> Yes ſay we, the <hi>Quakers</hi> never believed otherwiſe, and can praiſe God through Jeſus Chriſt, who is our Saviour and way to God; for the <hi>Quakers</hi> always affirm, that Chriſt as he was Man, dyed and taſted death for every Man once for all,
<pb n="26" facs="tcp:151551:61"/> and roſe again, and ſat down at the right hand of God: And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> confeſſes, <hi>That very offering of Jeſus Chriſt could not ſave us, but by the will and ordination of the Father.</hi> Here he is made to confeſs <hi>the Quakers Principles according to the Scripture</hi> (Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith) <hi>this Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth all right believers from all ſin;</hi> and yet he ſaith, <hi>None can be made free from ſin in this Life; and there is in all true Believers a curſed root of bitterneſs not caſt out, Death only makes conqueſt over Sin,</hi> page 87. And page 47. <hi>The Blood of Chriſt cleanſeth all right Believers from all ſin:</hi> What contradicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is this! And again he ſaith, <hi>And Chriſt,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>waſhed us from our ſin in his own Blood.</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith again, <hi>The cleanſing or waſhing cannot be within, but without us:</hi> But this Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath not proved in ſo many Scripture words; and though Chriſt was a Sacrifice, and his Fleſh and Blood ſuffered without upon the Croſs, yet Chriſt tells Prieſt <hi>Bond, If he do not eat his Fleſh, and drink his Blood, he hath no life in him; and if Chriſt be not in him he is a reprobate.</hi> And doth Chriſt juſtify Reprobates? And is not the Sin within a Man? And muſt not the Blood ſprinkle the Conſcience from dead works, <hi>&amp;c?</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>to be cleanſed from all ſin by the Blood of Jeſus Chriſt:</hi> So here Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> he hath left out <hi>his Son:</hi> And in page 47. and 46. he is finding falt with <hi>F. E.</hi> for leaving out <hi>his Son:</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>is to be underſtood for a cleanſing from all the guilt,</hi> &amp;c. But hath Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> no guilt when he commits ſin? But where doth the Scripture ſay, that Chriſt cleanſeth from the <hi>guilt of ſin only?</hi> and that <hi>we muſt have ſin while we be in the world? and in all true Believers there is a curſed root of bitter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs not caſt out, Death only makes a conqueſt over Sin?</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> what, doth this curſed root of bitterneſs bring no guilt of Sin? But we ſay, Chriſt who hath taken away the Curſe, and redeemed us from under the Curſe of the Law, cleanſeth from all ſin.</p>
                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, page 46. <hi>The Phariſees took Divine honour to themſelves, and thereby received honour one of another. Chriſt ſaid, ye receive honour one of another, and ſeek not the honour that comes from God only,</hi> John 5. But thou wrongs the Scriptures; for Chriſt doth not ſay, the <hi>Phariſees</hi> received <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vine honour</hi> to themſelves, thou adds that to the Scriptures. But what is the <hi>honour</hi> thou would have from the <hi>Quakers,</hi> thou would have them to ſay <hi>you</hi> to thee, and <hi>put off their Hats to thee,</hi> &amp;c. would thou? And if ſo, prove ſuch a practice by Scripture which thou calls thy Rule. And <hi>S. Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>He that made Heaven and Earth, Angels, Principalities and Powers, that hath a name above every name, that is named King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, the Prince and only Saviour that gives repentance and remiſſion of ſins, is in each of your vile bodies</hi> (to wit) <hi>you Quakers.</hi> Then Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls a rail<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, and ſaith, <hi>Is it not to be wondred at, that they are ſo poſſeſt with the infernal
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:151551:61"/> ſulfer of pride againſt Jeſus of Nazareth.</hi> Theſe baſe words Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> may apply to himſelf: But we are not aſhamed to confeſs Chriſt Jeſus, who is our only Saviour, who is King of Kings, and Lord of Lords, who rules in our hearts by Faith, who is aſcended above all Principalities and Powers, by whom all things were made, whom the Angels worſhips; I ſay, this Chriſt Jeſus of <hi>Nazareth</hi> rules in our hearts, and is revealed in us, and the Son of God is come, and we are in him, as <hi>John</hi> witneſſed; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore all Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> ſcoffing, lying words are returned back again upon himſelf, and ſo we know that our Bodies are Members of Chriſt, and Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples of the Holy-Ghoſt, 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. And the Apoſtle ſaid. <hi>Ye are the Temples of the living God,</hi> who ſaith, <hi>I will dwell in them, and walk in them, and I will be their God, and they ſhall be my people:</hi> And we have the comfort of the Scripture, 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 6. And if this Chriſt which we own be not in Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> then he is a Reprobate. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>In all Places and Countries, the generality of</hi> Quakers <hi>do purpoſely uſe theſe words,</hi> THEE <hi>and</hi> THOU, <hi>and deny all reverential reſpect to all ſorts of men; theſe things the unmannerly</hi> Qua<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kers <hi>will do: but the Scriptures do command all men to pray for Rulers, and to ſubmit unto them, and to give the honour thats due unto them:</hi> And therefore ſaith Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> over and over, <hi>The Light of the Scriptures doth reprove them.</hi> Page 41. 42, 43, 44, 45. He makes a great pudder about <hi>THOU</hi> and <hi>THEE,</hi> but to no purpoſe; Doth <hi>THOU</hi> and <hi>THEE</hi> diſhonour Magiſtrates? and to ſay <hi>YOU</hi> to them, is that the true honour and reverence that belongs to them? If ſo, let Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> prove it by <hi>Scripture,</hi> which thou ſaiſt is thy <hi>Rule.</hi> And thou ſaiſt, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>ſeeming Sanctity conſiſts in</hi> thee <hi>and</hi> thou, That is falſe; for Chriſt is our <hi>Sanctification:</hi> and <hi>thee</hi> and <hi>thou</hi> is according to the Scripture, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And three times over in the fortieth Page, Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>That we deny Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazereth, <hi>born of the Virgin</hi> Mary, which are all horrid lies (in Page 40. and 41.) For we own Chriſt Jeſus more than he. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, that <hi>John Crook ſaid, it was the Light within that was Cru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cified without the Gates of</hi> Jeruſalem: Theſe are more Lies; for Chriſt ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered in the Fleſh without the Gates of <hi>Jeruſalem, who enlightens every Man that comes into the World,</hi> and was quickned by the Spirit. <hi>Bond</hi> runs into his wicked words, and tells of an <hi>Inſide Chriſt:</hi> but he hath not proved ſuch a word in Scripture, Page 39. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The inſpired Scriptures of God are againſt the feigned Light of Chriſt within them,</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath brought no Scripture againſt the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chirſt</hi> ſhining in our Hearts, which gives us the knowledge of the Glory of God in the Face of Chriſt our Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our: And ſo it was the Apoſtles Doctrine, and reaching to bring People to the <hi>Light</hi> of <hi>Chirſt,</hi> which ſhined in their Hearts, which <hi>Light</hi> of Chriſt, thou calleſt an <hi>Idol</hi> and a <hi>feigned Light Chriſt within,</hi> Page 38. which thou haſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:151551:62"/> not proved by <hi>Scripture,</hi> which thou calleſt <hi>thy Rule;</hi> and by it thou art re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>proved. And Chriſt is manifeſt in us by his Spirit. Prieſt <hi>Bond, But all things reproved are made manifeſt by the Light of the Scripture, Scripture Light.</hi> Then how chanced it, the <hi>Jews</hi> were not <hi>reporved by Scripture Light?</hi> And what <hi>reproved</hi> before <hi>Scripture</hi> was written? or them that have not nor had not the <hi>Scripture?</hi> Had people no <hi>Light</hi> to <hi>reprove</hi> before the <hi>Scripture</hi> was written? And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Every one that doth evil, hates the</hi> Light, <hi>&amp;c. By the</hi> Light Chriſt, <hi>Underſtand the Doctrinal Light contained in the written Scripture of the New-Teſtament.</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> prove that the <hi>New-Teſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> was written when Chriſt Preacht that Doctrine, in John 3. And <hi>every one that doth evil, hates the Light, and will not come to it.</hi> Hath every one the <hi>Scriptures,</hi> that <hi>doth evil</hi> in the World? Prove that Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> who ſaiſt, <hi>that Scripture is the Light;</hi> for do not the Scriptures declare, that <hi>Chriſt enlightens every one that comes into the World?</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>That the True Chriſt hath ſtopped</hi> F. E's <hi>Mouth,</hi> and yet <hi>F. E.</hi> and he diſputes over and over in his Book afterwards. And then Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> goes to his Lies and Blaſphemous Language, <hi>Falſe Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Devil, Chriſt within is the falſe Chriſt the Devil,</hi> Page 36. And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> is made to confeſs in Page 21. 23. that F. E. the <hi>Quaker did confeſs the word took Fleſh, and in that Fleſh dyed for all Men, and</hi> further, F. E. <hi>did believe, that Jeſus Chriſt of</hi> Nazareth, <hi>a Man approved of God amongſt the People, whom the</hi> Jews <hi>hanged and ſlew, and God raiſed from the dead, and al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſo received up into Heaven, was the true Chriſt and only Saviour.</hi> And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith in the ſame 21. Page, <hi>That the Scriptures of Truth doth plainly charge the generality of</hi> Quakers <hi>with the guilt of the Sin againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, becauſe they have ſinned willfully, after a Profeſſion openly made of Faith in the Lord Chriſt, born of the Virgin Mary,</hi> &amp;c. See the Prieſts contradictions here in <hi>F. E's</hi> confeſſion, as Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> prints them: But theſe are all horrid Lies; for we are in the ſame Faith, which Chriſt Jeſus is the Author and Finiſher of; and the Scripture charges us with no ſuch thing which he falſly perverts and miſapplies; they are better applied to himſelf in ſinning againſt the Holy-Ghoſt, who calls Chriſt within, a <hi>Devil,</hi> and an <hi>Idol-Light,</hi> which will be his own Condemnation, Then he is making a pudder about Chriſts humane nature, and yet cannot give a Scripture to prove it, as in Page 55. And yet he ſaith, <hi>Chriſts Body of fleſh and bones, after the Reſurrection, was ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ritual,</hi> Page 72. And in Page 69. He ſaith, <hi>Stephen ſaw Chriſts Humane Body above.</hi> Are not theſe contradictions? And the Apoſtle ſaith, <hi>All things were made by Jeſus Chriſt,</hi> and <hi>all things were made by the Word,</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Name is called the Word of God.</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith to F. E. <hi>It is ſtrange that thou wilt produce a Chriſt for Evidence in whom thou doſt not believe,</hi> Page 34. And in Page 40. <hi>They deny that Jeſus Chriſt was come into the Fleſh</hi> And in Page
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:151551:62"/> 21. 23. <hi>They confeſs Chriſts coming into the Fleſh.</hi> Thou ſaiſt, and here thou contradicts thy ſelf, and ſaith and unſaith, and belies the <hi>Quakers.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou brings Chriſts Words, <hi>I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfect in me</hi> (to wit) <hi>Chriſt,</hi> (i. e.) <hi>that is in oneneſs of Affections; but affections</hi> he hath added, and what <hi>Affections</hi> them are he hath not declar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, Page 34. Yet thou ſaiſt, <hi>The Saints muſt have ſin in them as long as they live, and ſhall not be made free from Sin in this Life, and there is a Curſed Root of Bitterneſs in all true Believers, and not Caſt out, Death only makes Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſt over Sin,</hi> Page 87. So it is not <hi>Chriſt</hi> that makes an end of Sin, and his Blood that cleanſeth from Sin, and make their Garments white, and gives Victory and Conqueſt; but it is death, according to Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> Doctrine, that Conquers Sin. And thou ſaiſt, <hi>If the Man Chriſt Jeſus had not firſt given himſelf a Ranſome for our Sins,</hi> &amp;c. Page 32. And then thou ſaiſt, <hi>You muſt not be free from Sin in this Life.</hi> What contradictions are here And how art thou reconciled to God, and pleads thou ſhalt not be made free from Sin in this Life, which is of the Devil: And Chriſt enlightens every Man that comes into the World, who is the Redeemer, which Light thou calleſt an <hi>Idol Light within.</hi> The <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, thou that hates the Light of Chriſt, and calls it an Idol, thou hates thy Redeemer, and Chriſt (from whence it comes) who Redeems, Sanctifies, Waſhes and Juſtifies. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith. Page 31. That F. E. ſaith, <hi>He was Waſhed and Juſtified from Sin in ſome meaſure;</hi> Is any man Juſtified, but according to the meaſure of Faith? And thou finds fault with meaſure or degrees, and yet thou uſeſt the ſame word degrees, Page 31. And thou ſaiſt, <hi>That our Juſtification from Sin was once finiſhed and perfected without us, on the Croſs, with the Offering of the Body of Chriſt Jeſus once for all; and Chriſt gave himſelf a Ranſome for all,</hi> &amp;c. This the <hi>Quakers</hi> believe; But did Chriſt give himſelf a Ranſome for all? And was he an Offering for all Men? And how can Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſay, Chriſt hath Juſtified him from his Sin, or Waſht him from his Sin, when he ſaith, <hi>He ſhall not be free from Sin,</hi> (which is of the Devil) <hi>in this Life?</hi> And yet he finds fault with <hi>F. E.</hi> who ſaid, <hi>He was Waſhed and Juſtified from his Sin in ſome Meaſure;</hi> and calls it a <hi>dangerous Doctrine;</hi> and ſaith, <hi>Jeſus Chriſt of Nazareth hath once by his own Crucified Body without us on the Croſs, finiſhed Tranſgreſſion, and made an end of Sin.</hi> (Mark) <hi>made an end of Sin.</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith again, <hi>They ſhall not be made free from Sin in this Life; and there is in all true Believers a Curſed Root of bitterneſs not caſt out, death only</hi> (mark only) <hi>makes the Conqueſt over Sin:</hi> and yet Chriſt hath made an end of Sin. Then how can Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſay, <hi>Chriſts Death makes an end of Sin,</hi> as in Page 31. When they cannot be made free from it in this Life, it muſt be <hi>Death</hi> that muſt end it? So you may ſee what conrtadiction he
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:151551:63"/> makes, and what confuſion he is in. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> grants, that <hi>we could not he ſaved without the operation of his Spirit in us;</hi> and yet <hi>Chriſt within</hi> is a <hi>Devil,</hi> and his <hi>Light</hi> is an <hi>Idol Light</hi> he ſaith: And the <hi>Quakers</hi> own no other Chriſt within, but what the Apoſtles Preacht both without and within. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is the Spirit that quickens,</hi> John 6.63. But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath not proved this. Is not Chriſt who is the Saviour of the Soul a quickning Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit? as it is written, <hi>the firſt</hi> Adam <hi>was made a Living Soul; The ſecond</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dam <hi>was made a quickning Spirit.</hi> 1 Cor. 15.47. But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Though the Spirit be a dead Souls quickner, yet it is not the quickned Souls Savi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>our,</hi> Page 26. So then Chriſt the ſecond <hi>Adam,</hi> who is a quickning Spirit, is not the Souls Saviour, according to Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> Doctrine. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> makes a great deal of pudder in ſeveral Pages, concerning eating Chriſts Fleſh, and drinking his Blood, who ſaith, <hi>Except ye eat the Fleſh of the Son of Man, and drink his Blood, yee have no Life in you.</hi> Now we that eat the Fleſh of Chriſt, and drink his Blood by Faith, and have Life and Chriſt in us, this Chriſt Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith is a <hi>Devil,</hi> and his <hi>Light</hi> is an <hi>Idol.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> falls a Railing againſt the <hi>Quakers,</hi> in Page 20. and ſaith, <hi>Crucifying of the Son of God: Crucifying of him again,</hi> &amp;c. <hi>And have trod under foot the Blood of the Son of God.</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> is not this thy own condition, and not the <hi>Quakers,</hi> who calls Chriſt and his <hi>Light within</hi> his peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple an <hi>Idol,</hi> the <hi>Devil,</hi> And ſaiſt, <hi>The Saints ſhall not he made free from Sin in this Life?</hi> and the Apoſtle ſaid, <hi>That the Blood of Chriſt Jeſus the Son of God cleanſeth from all Sin.</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> makes a great deal of Pudder in three or four Pages concerning the <hi>Seed,</hi> in Page 19. Chriſt we ſay, is the <hi>Seed of the Woman which bruiſes the Serpents Head;</hi> and Chriſt is the Seed of <hi>A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>braham,</hi> in which ſeed all Nations are bleſt: and if ye be Chriſts, then are yee <hi>Abrahams</hi> Seed, and heirs according to the promiſe, and are the Children of God by Faith in Chriſt Jeſus. And we tell Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> Chriſt is the Seeds<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>man: And he may read in the Scriptures, what Chriſt calls the <hi>Seed</hi> that he ſows: and the <hi>good Seed</hi> are the Children of the Kingdom.</p>
                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou ſaiſt, <hi>Chriſt in you, the cauſe being put for the effect by a Metonyma;</hi> but he hath not proved the word <hi>Metonyma</hi> by Scripture, that he hath added; in Page 18. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> makes a great ſtur, Page 17. <hi>Of Chriſt being in his People;</hi> but why cannot he own the Apoſtles words, as they ſpeak plainly, which are better than his meanings, as in 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. <hi>Coloſſ.</hi> 1.27. and <hi>Amos</hi> 2.13. <hi>Geneſis</hi> 6.6. And there he is giving his mean<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings upon thoſe Scriptures, which are plain enough without his meanings and dark imaginations, who pretends <hi>Scripture</hi> to be his <hi>Rule,</hi> and the peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple muſt take his <hi>meanings</hi> to be the <hi>Rule.</hi> And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The Light within doth Juſtify the vileſt Antichriſts that are this day in the World; The
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:151551:63"/> Light within, which is by natural Generation in Reprobates, is not the true Chriſt,</hi> Page 16. ſaith Prieſt <hi>Bond.</hi> (Anſwer) Theſe are Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> horrid Lies and Blaſphemies. Chriſt who enlightens every man that comes into the World, Condemns the Antichriſts, and the <hi>wicked,</hi> and the <hi>Reprobates,</hi> that hate it and do not believe in it: And this <hi>Light</hi> doth not come by <hi>natural Generati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on,</hi> as Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſcoffingly ſaith; but the <hi>Light</hi> is called the <hi>Life in Chriſt</hi> the <hi>Word, by which all things were made,</hi> John 1. Page 16. And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> confeſſes in contradiction to himſelf and ſaith; <hi>It is true, by Light (To wit) Chriſt which enlightens every man that comes into the World is meant the true Chriſt and only Saviour,</hi> Page 8. And Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> goes over and over, and ſcoffingly and Blaſphemouſly ſaith, <hi>Chriſt within is a Devil;</hi> which he might as well have reflected on the Apoſtles, as on the <hi>Quakers:</hi> for the <hi>Quakers</hi> own the true Saviour manifeſt in them, as he was in the Apoſtles and Saints in their days: And it is falſe to ſay, <hi>That we make no diſtinction betwixt Chriſts Godhead and Chriſts Manhood,</hi> as in Page 12. Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> thou ſaiſt Page 10. <hi>But as for your Idol Light Chriſt, it was never viſible, but ever in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viſible.</hi> So here Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath ſet up an <hi>Inviſible Idol</hi> of his own making, in Page 10. And yet in Page 8. <hi>S. Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>It is true that by Light in that place of Scripture, the true Chriſt and our only Saviour is meant,</hi> John 1. And in Page 10. <hi>An Inviſible Idol.</hi> Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith Page 8. A <hi>Quaker attributes no more Soul-ſaving Merit to the Body of</hi> Jeſus, <hi>than to the Body of a</hi> Turk <hi>or a</hi> Jew. Theſe horrid Lyes Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> hath Forged, which Lyes of his was never the <hi>Quakers</hi> thoughts; For God prepared Chriſt a Body to do his Will, and to fulfill his Will, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> who was a ſacrifice for the Sins of the whole World, and dyed, and roſe again, and ſits at the Right Hand of God: and yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> made to confeſs that the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, <hi>That the Word took Fleſh of the Virgin, and that he ſuffered without the Gates of</hi> Jeruſalen, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And therefore Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> is to prove, who ever ſaid, <hi>That the Body of Chriſt at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tributes no more Soul ſaving Merit than to the Body of a</hi> Turk <hi>or a</hi> Jew. And again Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>I do acknowledge (with him</hi> (to wit) the <hi>Quaker that the effects of Chriſts death and ſufferings are to be inwardly Witneſſed within us,</hi> Page 8. And yet <hi>Chirſt within is a Devil, &amp; his Light an Idol within,</hi> How agrees the Blaſphemy with the Confeſſion? And who is it that works? Doth not Chriſt work inwardly in his People, by his Faith, Light and Spirit?

                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>The</hi> Quakers <hi>in</hi> Burmoudos <hi>Tryed, found guilty, Sentenced and Executed;</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> here is both <hi>Falſe-witneſs, Falſe Accuſor,</hi> and <hi>Flaſe Judge</hi> and <hi>Party:</hi> and yet accuſes <hi>Francis Eaſtlack,</hi> and ſaith, <hi>He that was the Party, made himſelf the determinating Judge,</hi> Page 6.

                  <p>Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>As I was about to read ſome of</hi> G. F<hi>'s Doctrine, they grew impatient, and by no means would have it read; thereupon I did forbear: But I have here inſerted it, to wit,</hi> G. Fox <hi>in his Boook entituled the</hi> Myſtery, Page 49. 50. <hi>Hath theſe words,</hi> 
                     <q>Ye ſcorn me the <hi>Light</hi> in you, they have diſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beyed it, and called it a <hi>natural Light,</hi> and ye have ſaid, that I the <hi>Light</hi> am not able to ſave theſe that believe in me. Furthermore Page 54. that if ye would believe, and wait on me the Light, I will purge out all your iniquity, and forgive all your Treſpaſſes, and I ſhall change your natures if you hearken to me, and obey the Light within.</q> 
                     <hi>Theſe are the words I would have read; but being hindred,</hi> &amp;c. (Anſwer) Theſe are Prieſt <hi>Bonds</hi> horrid Lies; for there is not one of theſe words in all the Pages of <hi>G. F's</hi> Book which Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> brings. S. <hi>Bond,</hi> thou brings <hi>G. F's</hi> query which any that reads <hi>G. F's</hi> Book may ſee, which he queries of the Prieſt, <hi>F. Higinſon, Where doth the Scripture ſpeak of</hi> Humane, <hi>the word</hi> Humane <hi>where is it writ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten? tell us, that we may ſearch for it? S. B.</hi> forger of theſe Lies. Now we do not deny that Chriſt, according to the Fleſh, was of <hi>Abraham,</hi> but not the word <hi>Humane;</hi> and <hi>Chriſts Nature</hi> is not <hi>Humane,</hi> which is <hi>Earthly,</hi> for that is the <hi>firſt Adam:</hi> And this is <hi>G. F's</hi> anſwer to <hi>Higinſon,</hi> who ſaid, <hi>That Chriſts Nature was Humane,</hi> &amp;c. And <hi>S. Bond</hi> in Page 50. makes a great pudder about it; but inſtead of proving of it, (which he hath not by Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, but hath made the matter worſe (and ſaith,) <hi>G. F. puts no difference betwixt</hi> Humane <hi>and</hi> Humane, which <hi>S. Bond</hi> hath proved neither of theſe words by <hi>Scripture,</hi> which he calls his <hi>Rule.</hi> And when he hath been beating the Air, he confeſſes, <hi>We have not ſuch a Word:</hi> And yet <hi>S. B.</hi> ſaith, <hi>Having the thing,</hi> who contradicts himſelf; but he hath not proved it. And again, <hi>S.

Bond</hi> ſaith, Stephen <hi>ſaw Chriſts humane Body in Heaven,</hi> Acts 7. Here thou wrongeſt the Scripture and <hi>Stephen,</hi> for there is not the word <hi>Humame</hi> in Acts 7. <hi>But Stephen being full of the Holy-Ghoſt, looked up ſtedfaſtly into Heaven, and ſaw the Glory of God and Jeſus ſtanding on the Right Hand of God, and ſaid, behold, I ſaw the Heavens opened, and the
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:151551:64"/> Son of Man ſtanding at the Right Hand of G d;</hi> So he ſaw Chriſt being full of the Holy-Ghoſt: And yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>Chirſts Fleſh and Bones was Spiritual after he was Riſen,</hi> Page 72. And the <hi>Quakers</hi> ſay, <hi>The Word of God is nigh thee, even in thy Mouth and in thy Heart,</hi> which is the Word of Faith that we and the Apoſtle preacht. And <hi>S. Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>&amp;c. I do not apprehend in</hi> Rom. 10.6. &amp;c. <hi>How theſe verſes do anſwer the argument of any one of them, which proves a</hi> Quakers <hi>pretended Saviour within to be a falſe Chriſt, the Devil,</hi> Page 13. <hi>Or how they preve the pretended Saviour within to be the true Chriſt;</hi> and yet Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> ſaith, <hi>As the righteouſneſs of Faith is the Redeemer a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt all doubts of Salvation,</hi> &amp;c. But Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> is not this <hi>Righteouſneſs of Faith</hi> within the Hearts of Gods people? And hi Page 15. <hi>S. Bond</hi> contradicts himſelf, and ſaith, <hi>That if thou ſhalt confeſs with thy mouth the Lord Jeſus Chriſt, and ſhall believe in thy heart that God hath raiſed him from the dead, thou ſhalt be ſaved, that is to ſay, the word of Faith Preacht is nigh in our Mouths.</hi> We have received Chriſt whom God hath revealed in our hearts, <hi>and hath ſent forth the Spirit of his Son into our hearts, crying Aba Father, Gal.</hi> 4. this we witneſs, 2. <hi>Cor.</hi> 13. Now <hi>S. Bond</hi> finds fault with <hi>G. F.</hi> for uſing the word <hi>their</hi> for <hi>our,</hi> as in Page 51. and ſaith, <hi>It is contrary to the Apoſtle.</hi> But in page 15. Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> uſes <hi>the word is nigh in our Mouths,</hi> inſtead of ſaying, <hi>The word is nigh thee even in thy Mouth;</hi> And ſo doth not he himſelf abuſe the Apoſtles words, as in <hi>Rom.</hi> 10. And I bring but this for him to ſee his own folly, who is <hi>Straining at Gnats, and ſwallowing Camels,</hi> though <hi>G. F's</hi> word <hi>our</hi> to us and <hi>their</hi> to the Apoſtles, is proper enough: and the word of Faith is nigh us in our hearts and mouths as well as in <hi>thy,</hi> as the Apoſtle ſaid: but Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> who cavils at Words, may ſee how he miſtakes himſelf, and utters forth his own Folly.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>S. Bond</hi> brings <hi>Thomas Moors</hi> ſaying, in Page 51. <hi>That Chriſt was abſent from us. while we were in this Mortal Body.</hi> And <hi>G. F.</hi> anſwers contrary to the Apoſtle, who ſaid, <hi>The Life of Chriſt is manifeſt in their Mortal Fleſh:</hi> yes, and we ſay again, that the Life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our Mortal Fleſh: and Chriſt is in us the hope of Glory. But <hi>Bond</hi> makes a great pudder, that the <hi>Life of Chriſt Jeſus might</hi> (not is, <hi>but) be made manifeſt in (not their, but) our mortal Fleſh.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But <hi>SB.</hi> How fooliſhly thou ſtrains at <hi>Gnats</hi> and ſwallows <hi>Camels;</hi> for <hi>G.

So we ſay, <hi>theirs</hi> (to wit) the <hi>Apoſtles</hi> and the <hi>Church</hi> in their days; and we ſay <hi>ours</hi> in <hi>our days</hi> (to wit) <hi>for we which Live, are always delivered unto Death for Jeſus ſake, that the Life alſo of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in our mortal Bodies.</hi> And ſo here it is plain, <hi>in their mortal
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:151551:65"/> Fleſh,</hi> and in <hi>our mortal Fleſh.</hi> And doth <hi>S. B.</hi> ſay, that the Life of Jeſus was not manifeſt in the Apoſtles mortal Fleſh, and the Churches, and them that hear it too? and will not <hi>S.

And there is no ſuch ſaying in that Text of Scripture, <hi>That the Life of Jeſus might be made manifeſt in their mortal Fleſh.</hi> I query of <hi>S.

And is not the Light called the Life,</hi> John 1. <hi>in Chriſts Word? And doth not the Light ſhine in our Hearts,</hi> 2 Cor. 4.6? And thou ſaiſt, Page 51. <hi>That</hi> Fox <hi>endeavours as much as in him lies to choak the Lamb of God.</hi> But Prieſt <hi>Bond,</hi> Can Chriſt the Lamb of God which hath all power in Heaven and Earth given to him, be <hi>Choaked? Doſt not thou herein ſhew thy Fooliſhneſs and Sillineſs?</hi> And as for his railing againſt <hi>J. Pennington,</hi> he hath not Quo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted the Page where to find what he ſaith againſt him, neither hath he named <hi>John Chanlers</hi> Book, which he rails at againſt him. And therefore it is like he hath belied them as he hath done <hi>G. F.</hi> and others. And therefore Prieſt <hi>Bond</hi> had better Repent, if he can find a place of Repentance for all his Lying Blaſphemies, and ſtuddy to be quiet; for he hath given forth his Book to his Shame.</p>
                  <p>And <hi>S.
